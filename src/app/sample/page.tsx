          Prologue: The Seven
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-8 text-center text-sm italic text-stone-500">
          Twelve Years Earlier
        </p>

        <p>The farmers knelt in the mud.</p>
        <p>
          Seven of them. Hands bound, heads bowed, rain pouring down faces too
          exhausted for tears. They&rsquo;d been dragged from their homes at
          dawn, forced to march twelve miles to the capital, and now they waited
          in the courtyard of the Ministry of Justice while soldiers formed a
          perimeter and nobles gathered on covered balconies to watch.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prince Cassian stood at the edge of the square, his ceremonial armor
          gleaming despite the downpour. Twenty-three years old. Second son of
          the King. The sword at his hip had never tasted blood.
        </p>
        <p>That was about to change.</p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;The accused are charged with rebellion against the Crown.&rdquo;
          Lord Evander&rsquo;s voice carried across the courtyard from beneath a
          silk canopy. He was a large man, fleshy, with the soft hands of someone
          who&rsquo;d never worked a day in his life. His estate bordered the
          farmland these men had worked for generations. &ldquo;They refused
          lawful taxation and incited others to defy the King&rsquo;s appointed
          collectors.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p className="italic text-stone-400">
          They petitioned for fair grain prices. That&rsquo;s all they did.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cassian had read the reports. Every word. The farmers had followed
          every legal channel, submitted proper paperwork, attended the required
          hearings, waited months for responses that never came. When the tax
          collectors arrived demanding twice the assessed rate, they&rsquo;d
          simply asked for documentation. A reasonable request. A legal right
          under laws older than the dynasty.
        </p>
        <p>Lord Evander had called it rebellion.</p>
        <p>The King had agreed.</p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;Prince Cassian.&rdquo; His father&rsquo;s voice cut through the
          rain. King Daveth stood on the covered dais, arms folded, face carved
          from stone. &ldquo;Execute the sentence.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>Cassian didn&rsquo;t move.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Your Majesty&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;The accused have been found guilty by lawful tribunal. You will
          carry out the sentence. That is my command.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          The courtyard had gone silent. Nobles on balconies leaned forward.
          Soldiers shifted uneasily. And the seven farmers knelt in the mud, rain
          running down their faces, waiting to die.
        </p>
        <p>
          The youngest was barely older than Cassian. Twenty at most, with the
          calloused hands of someone who&rsquo;d spent his life working the soil.
          His father knelt beside him, grey-haired and stooped, whispering
          something Cassian couldn&rsquo;t hear.
        </p>
        <p>A prayer, probably. Or a goodbye.</p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;Cassian.&rdquo; The King&rsquo;s voice dropped, meant only for
          his son. &ldquo;You will not shame this house.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p className="italic text-stone-400">
          I&rsquo;m going to kill innocent people.
        </p>
        <p>
          The thought crystallized with terrible clarity. He&rsquo;d known this
          day would come. Had been trained for it since childhood, conditioned to
          believe that a prince&rsquo;s duty sometimes required hard choices. But
          the training had been abstract. Theoretical. He&rsquo;d practiced sword
          forms and studied the warrior code and told himself that justice and
          duty were the same thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          They weren&rsquo;t. Standing here, rain soaking through his ceremonial
          cloak, he understood that with a certainty that made his stomach
          clench.
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;Move, boy.&rdquo; Lord Evander&rsquo;s voice, impatient.
          &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have all day.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          Cassian&rsquo;s feet carried him forward. One step. Two. The mud sucked
          at his boots like the earth itself was trying to hold him back.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first farmer looked up as Cassian approached. Middle-aged,
          weathered, deep lines around eyes that had spent decades squinting
          against the sun. He didn&rsquo;t beg. Just looked at Cassian with
          exhausted resignation.
        </p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Cassian whispered.</p>
        <p>The farmer nodded slightly. &ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Cassian drew his sword.</p>

        <div className="my-10 flex justify-center">
          <span className="text-2xl text-stone-600">&#8258; &#8258; &#8258;</span>
        </div>

        <p>
          The blade was beautiful. That was what he&rsquo;d remember later, in
          the nightmares. The way the steel caught the grey light, the way rain
          beaded on the polished surface, the way it felt in his hand. Perfectly
          balanced. A masterwork designed for one purpose only.
        </p>
        <p>He raised it above his head.</p>
        <p className="italic text-stone-400">
          I can refuse. I can throw down the sword, denounce this farce, tell my
          father I won&rsquo;t murder innocent people for political convenience.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then what? The farmers would still die. Another prince would
          execute them, or soldiers would, or they&rsquo;d rot in prison until
          disease finished the job. His defiance would accomplish nothing except
          his own destruction.
        </p>
        <p>
          One act of defiance couldn&rsquo;t change the system. One prince
          couldn&rsquo;t overturn five thousand years of tradition.
        </p>
        <p className="italic text-stone-400">
          Coward. You&rsquo;re looking for excuses to do what you were always
          going to do.
        </p>
        <p>The first farmer closed his eyes.</p>
        <p>Cassian brought the sword down.</p>

        <div className="my-10 flex justify-center">
          <span className="text-2xl text-stone-600">&#8258; &#8258; &#8258;</span>
        </div>

        <p>
          The body fell forward into the mud. Blood mixed with rainwater,
          spreading in a crimson pool that reflected the grey sky. The courtyard
          was utterly silent. Just the sound of rain falling on stone.
        </p>
        <p>His hands were shaking. His vision had narrowed to a tunnel.</p>
        <p className="italic text-stone-400">Six more.</p>
        <p>
          The thought almost broke him. Six more people, waiting in the mud. The
          grey-haired father. The young man his own age. Four others, nameless in
          his panic-blurred vision.
        </p>
        <p>He moved to the second farmer.</p>

        <div className="my-10 flex justify-center">
          <span className="text-2xl text-stone-600">&#8258; &#8258; &#8258;</span>
        </div>

        <p>
          Afterward, he wouldn&rsquo;t remember the individual deaths. They
          blurred together in a red haze. The swing of the blade, the spray of
          blood, the way bodies collapsed like puppets with severed strings. His
          training taking over where his mind had shut down, each stroke precise
          because that was what he&rsquo;d been taught.
        </p>
        <p className="italic text-stone-400">
          Make it clean. A warrior owes his enemies a clean death.
        </p>
        <p>
          These weren&rsquo;t his enemies. They were farmers who&rsquo;d asked
          for fair treatment and received execution instead.
        </p>
        <p>
          When it was over, seven bodies lay in the mud.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cassian stood among them, rain washing the blood from his blade, and
          felt something inside him shatter.
        </p>
        <p>
          He looked at his hands. The right one still gripped the sword. The left
          was empty, trembling, smeared with blood that wasn&rsquo;t his.
        </p>
        <p>
          He drove the blade into the earth and knelt in the mud beside the last
          farmer. The man&rsquo;s face was peaceful. Eyes closed. Rain collecting
          in the hollows of his cheeks.
        </p>
        <p className="italic text-stone-400">
          Remember this. Remember what you did. Never let yourself forget.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cassian drew his knife. Pressed the edge against his own palm, where
          the lifeline met the base of his thumb. And drew it across.
        </p>
        <p>
          The pain was sharp and immediate. Blood welled, hot against the
          rain&rsquo;s cold. He watched it drip onto the mud, mingling with the
          blood of the men he&rsquo;d killed.
        </p>
        <p>
          A mark. A record. A scar he would carry for the rest of his life, so
          that every time he looked at his hands, he would remember what those
          hands had done.
        </p>
        <p>
          The cut was deep enough to scar. Not deep enough to cripple. He knew
          the difference. He&rsquo;d been trained to know the difference.
        </p>
        <p>
          He wrapped his hand in a strip torn from his cloak and stood.
        </p>
        <p>
          Seven dead. One wound. A debt that no amount of scarring could repay.
        </p>

        <div className="my-10 flex justify-center">
          <span className="text-2xl text-stone-600">&#8258; &#8258; &#8258;</span>
        </div>

        <p>The feast that night was elaborate.</p>
        <p>
          Lord Evander had insisted on celebrating the &ldquo;suppression of
          rebellion.&rdquo; The great hall was filled with nobles and officers,
          music and laughter, the finest food the kingdom could offer. Servants
          moved through the crowd with silver platters while guests toasted the
          health of the King.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cassian stood by a window, as far from the revelry as he could manage.
          His ceremonial armor had been replaced with formal attire, but he could
          still feel the pressure of it. Could still feel the mud pulling at his
          boots, the resistance as the blade met flesh.
        </p>
        <p>&ldquo;You did well today.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>
          His father&rsquo;s voice. Cassian turned to find the King beside him,
          goblet in hand, expression unreadable.
        </p>
        <p>&ldquo;I killed innocent men.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;You executed criminals who defied the Crown&rsquo;s lawful
          authority.&rdquo; The King&rsquo;s tone was patient, a teacher
          correcting a student. &ldquo;The tribunal found them guilty. The
          sentence was passed according to law.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;They petitioned for fair grain prices. That&rsquo;s not
          rebellion.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;Lord Evander&rsquo;s assessments were legal. The farmers&rsquo;
          refusal to pay was criminal.&rdquo; The King took a sip of wine.
          &ldquo;This is how order is maintained. How kingdoms survive. The line
          between petition and insurrection is thinner than you think.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>&ldquo;They weren&rsquo;t insurrectionists. They were farmers.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;They were examples.&rdquo; The King&rsquo;s voice hardened.
          &ldquo;Lord Evander needed his authority reinforced. I needed his
          support for the eastern campaign. Those farmers served a purpose. Their
          deaths secured an alliance that will save ten thousand lives in the
          wars to come.&rdquo; He fixed Cassian with eyes like flint.
          &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what ruling requires. The willingness to sacrifice
          the few for the many.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          Cassian stared at his father. For the first time in his life, he saw
          not a king but a father who had convinced himself that murder was
          mathematics. That cruelty was merely calculation. That the lives of
          common people were currency to be spent when convenient.
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;What if the calculation is wrong? What if there was another
          way?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>&ldquo;There wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;How do you know? Did you try?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>
          Something flickered behind the King&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
          young. You&rsquo;ll learn.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to learn this.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;Want has nothing to do with it.&rdquo; The King turned away.
          &ldquo;You are a Stormborn. The mark on your shoulder binds you to
          duties whether you want them or not.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          He walked away, leaving Cassian alone by the window.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Necessary.</em> The word tasted like ashes. Somewhere out there,
          seven families were grieving. Wives learning they were widows. Children
          learning they were orphans.
        </p>
        <p>And he had been the instrument of that lie.</p>

        <div className="my-10 flex justify-center">
          <span className="text-2xl text-stone-600">&#8258; &#8258; &#8258;</span>
        </div>

        <p>Three days later, Cassian stood in his father&rsquo;s study.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I need you to investigate Lord Evander.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>The King looked up. &ldquo;Investigate?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;The evidence against those farmers was fabricated. The witnesses
          were paid. The whole thing was a pretense to seize their land.&rdquo;
          Cassian laid a folder on the desk. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s using the
          Crown&rsquo;s authority to expand his estates through murder.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>
          Two words. Spoken without surprise. As if Cassian had told him the sky
          was blue.
        </p>
        <p>&ldquo;You... know?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;Lord Evander has been consolidating farmland for years. His
          methods are distasteful but effective. His grain production has
          increased forty percent.&rdquo; The King set down his pen. &ldquo;The
          kingdom needs that grain. The eastern provinces are facing drought.
          Without Evander&rsquo;s surplus, people will starve.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;So you let him murder farmers to increase his yields?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;I let him do what&rsquo;s necessary to feed the realm. Seven
          farmers die, ten thousand eat. That&rsquo;s the mathematics of
          power.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s monstrous.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;That&rsquo;s reality.&rdquo; The King stood, moving around the
          desk. &ldquo;Every king who&rsquo;s sat on this throne has made the
          same calculations. We let lords do ugly things because the alternative
          is worse. That&rsquo;s what ruling <em>is</em>, Cassian.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>&ldquo;Then I renounce it.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>
          Silence fell between them. The King&rsquo;s expression didn&rsquo;t
          change.
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;You would abandon your family? Your duty? Everything you were
          raised to be?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;I would walk away from murder. Yes.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;Walking away doesn&rsquo;t change anything. The murders will
          continue. Lord Evander will keep seizing land. Your absence won&rsquo;t
          stop that. It will only prove you were too weak to face it.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          But Cassian looked at his father and saw the lie beneath the words. It
          wasn&rsquo;t weakness that killed those farmers. It was power. Power
          that corrupted everyone who touched it, that convinced good men to do
          terrible things and called it necessity.
        </p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather be weak than be this.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>He walked toward the door.</p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;If you leave,&rdquo; the King said, &ldquo;you cannot come
          back. The shame will poison everything you touch. Your brothers will
          suffer for your cowardice.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          Cassian paused, hand on the door. &ldquo;My mother taught me that
          strength without mercy is just cruelty wearing armor. She would be
          ashamed of what I did. What you made me do.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>&ldquo;Marianne understood duty.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Then she was wrong too.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>He pulled open the door.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Cassian.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>
          Something in the King&rsquo;s voice made him stop. Not command. Almost
          like pain.
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;If you walk through that door, you walk alone. No resources, no
          protection, no name. You&rsquo;ll have nothing.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          Cassian looked back. His father stood in the center of the study, the
          most powerful man in the kingdom, and somehow utterly alone.
        </p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have my conscience.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Conscience won&rsquo;t keep you warm at night.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;Maybe not. But at least I&rsquo;ll be able to live with
          myself.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
          Three nights later, he boarded a cargo ship in the dead of night.
        </p>
        <p>
          He carried one bag and the clothes on his back. Everything else
          abandoned. The armor, the weapons, the title, the life. All of it shed
          like poisoned skin.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ship&rsquo;s captain asked no questions. In Greyport, where the
          ship was bound, false names were more common than real ones.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the ship pulled away from the dock, Cassian stood at the stern and
          watched the coast of Valdrath shrink into fog. The palace was invisible
          from here, but he could picture his father&rsquo;s study, his
          brothers&rsquo; chambers, his mother&rsquo;s empty room that no one had
          touched since her death.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Take care of them,</em> she&rsquo;d whispered in those final
          moments, her hand cold in his. <em>All of them. Promise me.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;I tried,&rdquo; Cassian said to the fog. &ldquo;I tried, and I
          failed, and now I&rsquo;m running because I can&rsquo;t be the weapon
          he wants me to be.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>The coastline disappeared.</p>
        <p>He was twenty-three years old.</p>
        <p>He would spend the next twelve years trying to forget what he&rsquo;d done.</p>
        <p>He would fail.</p>

          Chapter 1: The Fight
        </h2>

        <p>
          Seven soldiers surrounded an old woman in the church parking lot.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cassian saw them through the rain from thirty yards away, standing at
          the edge of the lot where the broken streetlight left a pocket of
          shadow. Dark uniforms, royal bronze piping on the shoulders, weapons at
          their hips &mdash; the standard kit of provincial enforcement, a step
          above thugs and a step below actual military. Mrs. Chen&rsquo;s back
          was pressed against the stone wall of the church, her grey hair
          plastered to her skull by the downpour, and one of the soldiers was
          shouting about taxes while another kicked her purse across the wet
          asphalt. The purse&rsquo;s contents scattered, a jade compact,
          prescription bottles, the fabric wallet she&rsquo;d had for as long as
          Cassian had known her.
        </p>
        <p className="italic text-stone-400">
          Keep walking. This isn&rsquo;t your fight.
        </p>
        <p>
          He&rsquo;d spent twelve years building that mantra into his bones.
          Twelve years of being nobody. Twelve years of turning away from
          injustice because the last time he&rsquo;d tried to face it, seven
          people had died. The rain dripped from his collar as he stood frozen
          mid-step, watching Mrs. Chen&rsquo;s receipts dissolve in a puddle
          while soldiers laughed.
        </p>
        <p className="italic text-stone-400">
          You swore you&rsquo;d never do this again.
        </p>
        <p>
          But she looked so small against that wall. And the soldiers wore his
          family&rsquo;s colors.
        </p>

        <p>
          Sunday service had ended twenty minutes ago. Cassian had lingered in
          the back pew until the sanctuary emptied, as he always did. The Church
          of the Eternal Blade felt safer when it was just him and the flickering
          forge-light and the silence of a God who never answered. Tonight the
          prayers had been especially hollow. He&rsquo;d knelt on worn wood, lips
          moving through the Warrior&rsquo;s Litany, and felt nothing but the
          familiar ache of guilt that twelve years of confession couldn&rsquo;t
          absolve.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mrs. Chen had taught him to fold dumplings last winter. Her small hands
          guiding his through the delicate motion of sealing the edges, patient
          with his clumsiness. &ldquo;Food made with care,&rdquo; she&rsquo;d
          said, &ldquo;feeds more than the body.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          She&rsquo;d never asked about his scars. Never asked about the darkness
          that sometimes surfaced behind his eyes. She&rsquo;d simply accepted
          him as Thomas Thorne, a quiet mechanic who kept to himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Glass shattered. Her car window. She cried out, a sound that cut
          through the rain like a blade through cloth.
        </p>
        <p>Cassian turned.</p>

        <div className="my-10 flex justify-center">
          <span className="text-2xl text-stone-600">&#8258; &#8258; &#8258;</span>

        <p>
          Seven soldiers. Standard intimidation formation. He recognized it from
          training sessions he&rsquo;d rather forget. One held a tablet,
          scrolling through data with bureaucratic detachment. Another had
          shattered the window of Mrs. Chen&rsquo;s ancient sedan. Her purse lay
          open on the wet ground, contents scattered. A jade compact. A faded
          photograph. Prescription bottles.
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my car!&rdquo; Mrs. Chen clutched her purse like a
          shield. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t&mdash;I&rsquo;ve done nothing wrong.
          I&rsquo;ve paid every tax, every fee&mdash;&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;We can do whatever we want, grandmother.&rdquo; The lead soldier
          stepped forward, boot splashing in a puddle. Young, mid-twenties, with
          an expression that came from never being told no. His insignia marked
          him as a sergeant. &ldquo;This is official business. Taxes are
          owed.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;I paid! I have the receipts&mdash;&rdquo; Her hands shook as
          she fumbled. Papers spilled onto the wet ground. Receipts she&rsquo;d
          kept because she&rsquo;d learned long ago that the poor had to prove
          their innocence in ways the wealthy never did.
        </p>
        <p>
          The soldier kicked the documents aside, ink running in the rain.
          &ldquo;Looks like you can&rsquo;t find them. Unfortunate. Property it
          is, then.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          The soldiers laughed. One made a crude comment about what else they
          might collect. Another reached for Mrs. Chen&rsquo;s arm.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cassian was moving before he made a conscious decision. Twelve years of
          careful invisibility, and here he was walking straight toward trouble.
          Like the prince who&rsquo;d questioned his father&rsquo;s orders. Like
          the soldier who&rsquo;d hesitated at the worst possible moment and let
          seven farmers die.
        </p>
        <p>
          But Mrs. Chen was crying, and something cracked open that twelve years
          hadn&rsquo;t sealed shut.
        </p>
        <p>&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t owe you anything.&rdquo;</p>
