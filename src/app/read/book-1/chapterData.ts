      "The farmers knelt in the mud.",
      "Seven of them. Hands bound behind their backs, heads bowed, rain streaming down faces too exhausted for tears. They’d been dragged from their homes at dawn, forced to march twelve miles to the capital, and now they waited in the courtyard of the Ministry of Justice while soldiers formed a perimeter and nobles gathered on covered balconies to watch.",
      "Prince Cassian stood at the edge of the square, his ceremonial armor gleaming despite the downpour. Twenty-three years old. Second son of the King. The sword at his hip had never tasted blood.",
      "That was about to change.",
      "“The accused are charged with rebellion against the Crown,” Lord Evander announced from beneath a silk canopy, his voice carrying across the courtyard with practiced authority. He was a large man, fleshy, with the soft hands of someone who’d never worked a day in his life. His estate bordered the farmland these men had worked for generations. “They refused lawful taxation and incited others to defy the King’s appointed collectors.”",
      "They petitioned for fair grain prices, Cassian thought. That’s all they did.",
      "He’d read the reports. The farmers had followed every legal channel—submitted proper paperwork, attended the required hearings, waited months for responses that never came. When the tax collectors arrived demanding twice the assessed rate, they’d simply asked for documentation. A reasonable request. A legal right under laws older than the dynasty.",
      "Lord Evander had called it rebellion.",
      "The King had agreed.",
      "“Prince Cassian.” His father’s voice cut through the rain. King Daveth stood on the covered dais, arms folded, face carved from stone. “Execute the sentence.”",
      "Cassian didn’t move. Couldn’t move. The sword at his hip felt impossibly heavy, a weight that pressed down through his bones and into the earth beneath his feet.",
      "“Your Majesty—”",
      "“The accused have been found guilty by lawful tribunal.” The King’s eyes were cold, unblinking. “You will carry out the sentence. That is my command.”",
      "Around them, the courtyard had gone silent. Nobles on balconies leaned forward, eager for spectacle. Soldiers shifted uneasily, hands on weapons. And the seven farmers knelt in the mud, rain running down their faces, waiting to die.",
      "The youngest was barely older than Cassian. A boy, really—twenty at most, with the calloused hands of someone who’d spent his life working the soil. His father knelt beside him, grey-haired and stooped, whispering something Cassian couldn’t hear.",
      "A prayer, probably. Or a goodbye.",
      "“Cassian.” The King’s voice dropped, meant only for his son. “You will not shame this house.”",
      "I’m going to kill innocent people.",
      "The thought crystallized in Cassian’s mind with terrible clarity. He’d known this day would come—had been trained for it since childhood, conditioned to believe that a prince’s duty sometimes required hard choices. But the training had been abstract. Theoretical. He’d practiced sword forms and studied the warrior code and told himself that justice and duty were the same thing.",
      "They weren’t. Standing here, rain soaking through his ceremonial cloak, he understood that with a certainty that made his stomach clench.",
      "“Move, boy.” Lord Evander’s voice, impatient. “We don’t have all day.”",
      "Cassian’s feet carried him forward. One step. Two. The mud sucked at his boots like the earth itself was trying to hold him back, trying to save him from what he was about to do.",
      "The first farmer looked up as Cassian approached. Middle-aged, weathered, with deep lines around eyes that had spent decades squinting against the sun. He didn’t beg. Didn’t plead. Just looked at Cassian with a kind of exhausted resignation, as if he’d known this was coming all along.",
      "“I’m sorry,” Cassian whispered. The words came out broken, barely audible over the rain.",
      "The farmer nodded slightly. “I know.”",
      "Cassian drew his sword.",
      "The blade was beautiful. That was what Cassian would remember later, in the nightmares that would plague him for years afterward. The way the steel caught the grey light, the way rain beaded on the polished surface, the way it felt in his hand—perfectly balanced, perfectly crafted, a masterwork of the smith’s art designed for one purpose only.",
      "He raised it above his head.",
      "I can refuse, he thought. I can throw down the sword, denounce this farce, tell my father that I won’t murder innocent people for political convenience.",
      "And then what? The farmers would still die—another prince would execute them, or soldiers would, or they’d simply rot in prison until disease or starvation finished them. His defiance would accomplish nothing except his own destruction. He’d be stripped of his title, imprisoned, possibly executed himself. His mother would grieve. His brothers would suffer the shame.",
      "One act of defiance couldn’t change the system. One prince couldn’t overturn five thousand years of tradition.",
      "Coward, a voice whispered in his head. You’re looking for excuses to do what you were always going to do.",
      "The first farmer closed his eyes.",
      "Cassian brought the sword down.",
      "The body fell forward into the mud. Blood mixed with rainwater, spreading in a crimson pool that reflected the grey sky. The courtyard was utterly silent—no gasps from the watching nobles, no cries from the remaining prisoners. Just the sound of rain falling on stone.",
      "Cassian’s hands were shaking. His vision had narrowed to a tunnel, the world reduced to the space immediately in front of him. He couldn’t feel the rain anymore. Couldn’t feel anything except the weight of the sword in his grip and the terrible wrongness of what he’d just done.",
      "Six more.",
      "The thought almost broke him. Six more people, waiting in the mud, waiting for him to end their lives. The grey-haired father. The young man who might have been his age. Four others, nameless and faceless in Cassian’s panic-blurred vision.",
      "He moved to the second farmer.",
      "Afterward, he wouldn’t remember the individual deaths. They blurred together in a red haze of horror—the swing of the blade, the spray of blood, the way bodies collapsed like puppets with severed strings. He operated on autopilot, his training taking over where his mind had shut down, each stroke precise and efficient because that was what he’d been taught.",
      "Make it clean, his sword instructor had always said. A warrior owes his enemies a clean death.",
      "These weren’t his enemies. They were farmers who’d asked for fair treatment and received execution instead. But Cassian’s body didn’t care about justice. His body only knew the forms, the angles, the proper technique for severing a human spine.",
      "When it was over, seven bodies lay in the mud.",
      "Cassian stood among them, rain washing the blood from his blade, and felt something inside him shatter.",
      "The feast that night was elaborate.",
      "Lord Evander had insisted on celebrating the “suppression of rebellion”—a phrase that made Cassian’s gorge rise every time he heard it. The great hall was filled with nobles and officers, music and laughter, the finest food and wine the kingdom could offer. Servants moved through the crowd with silver platters while guests toasted to the health of the King and the security of the realm.",
      "Cassian stood by a window, as far from the revelry as he could manage without actually leaving. His ceremonial armor had been replaced with formal attire, but he could still feel the weight of it. Could still feel the mud pulling at his boots, the rain on his face, the resistance as the blade met flesh.",
      "You killed seven people today.",
      "The thought kept circling, a vulture that wouldn’t land. He’d washed his hands three times since returning to the palace, scrubbing until his skin was raw, but he could still feel the blood on them. Could still see it pooling in the courtyard, mixing with the rain.",
      "“You did well today.”",
      "His father’s voice. Cassian turned to find the King standing beside him, a goblet of wine in hand, expression as unreadable as always.",
      "“I killed innocent men.”",
      "“You executed criminals who defied the Crown’s lawful authority.” The King’s tone was patient, the voice of a teacher correcting a student’s error. “The tribunal found them guilty. The sentence was passed according to law. You merely carried it out.”",
      "“They petitioned for fair grain prices. That’s not rebellion.”",
      "“Lord Evander’s assessments were legal. The farmers’ refusal to pay was criminal.” The King took a sip of wine, studying Cassian over the rim of his goblet. “This is how order is maintained, boy. How kingdoms survive. You can’t allow the common folk to question authority, or soon they’ll question everything. The line between petition and insurrection is thinner than you think.”",
      "“They weren’t insurrectionists. They were farmers.”",
      "“They were examples.” The King’s voice hardened slightly. “Lord Evander needed his authority reinforced. I needed his support for the eastern campaign. Those farmers served a purpose—their deaths secured an alliance that will save ten thousand lives in the wars to come.” He set down his goblet, fixing Cassian with eyes like flint. “That’s what ruling requires. The willingness to make hard choices. The strength to sacrifice the few for the many.”",
      "Cassian stared at his father. For the first time in his life, he saw not a king but a man—a man who had convinced himself that murder was mathematics, that cruelty was merely calculation, that the lives of common people were currency to be spent when convenient.",
      "“What if the calculation is wrong?” Cassian heard himself say. “What if Lord Evander’s alliance isn’t worth seven lives? What if there was another way to secure his support?”",
      "“There wasn’t.”",
      "“How do you know? Did you try?”",
      "The King’s expression didn’t change, but something flickered behind his eyes—the first sign of genuine emotion Cassian had seen all day. “You’re young. You’ll learn.”",
      "“I don’t want to learn this.”",
      "“Want has nothing to do with it.” The King turned away, dismissing the conversation. “You are a Stormborn. The mark on your shoulder binds you to duties whether you want them or not. When you’ve had more time to reflect, you’ll understand that what we did today was necessary.”",
      "He walked away, leaving Cassian alone by the window.",
      "Necessary.",
      "The word tasted like ashes. Cassian looked out at the night, at the rain still falling, at the city spread out below the palace walls. Somewhere out there, seven families were grieving. Wives learning they were widows. Children learning they were orphans. A whole community learning that justice in Valdrath was a lie told by the powerful to the powerless.",
      "And he had been the instrument of that lie.",
      "Three days later, Cassian stood in his father’s study.",
      "“I need you to investigate Lord Evander.”",
      "The King looked up from his papers, eyebrows rising. “Investigate?”",
      "“The farmers he accused—I’ve been reading the trial transcripts. The evidence against them was fabricated. The witnesses were paid. The whole thing was a pretense to seize their land.” Cassian laid a folder on the desk, documents he’d spent three sleepless nights gathering. “He’s using the Crown’s authority to expand his estates through murder.”",
      "“I know.”",
      "Two words. Spoken without emotion, without surprise. As if Cassian had told him the sky was blue.",
      "“You… know?”",
      "“Lord Evander has been consolidating farmland for years. His methods are distasteful but effective. His grain production has increased forty percent since he began.” The King set down his pen, giving Cassian his full attention. “The kingdom needs that grain, boy. The eastern provinces are facing drought. Without Evander’s surplus, people will starve.”",
      "“So you let him murder farmers to increase his yields?”",
      "“I let him do what’s necessary to feed the realm.” The King’s voice was steel wrapped in patience. “Politics is about trade-offs. Seven farmers die, ten thousand eat. That’s the mathematics of power.”",
      "“That’s monstrous.”",
      "“That’s reality.” The King stood, moving around the desk to face his son. “You think this is new? You think you’ve uncovered some terrible secret? Every king who’s ever sat on this throne has made the same calculations. We let lords do ugly things because the alternative is worse. We look away from small cruelties to prevent large catastrophes. That’s what ruling is, Cassian. The willingness to be hated so your people can survive.”",
      "“I didn’t sign up for this.”",
      "“You were born into it. The day my blood became your blood, you inherited both the privileges and the responsibilities of the Crown. You don’t get to choose which parts you accept.”",
      "Cassian’s jaw clenched so hard his teeth ached. “Then I renounce it.”",
      "Silence fell between them, thick and dangerous. The King’s expression didn’t change, but something shifted in his posture—a predator recognizing a challenge.",
      "“You would abandon your family? Your duty? Everything you were raised to be?”",
      "“I would walk away from murder. Yes.”",
      "“Walking away doesn’t change anything. The murders will continue whether you’re here or not. Lord Evander will keep seizing land. The Crown will keep looking away. Your absence won’t stop that—it will only prove that you were too weak to face it.”",
      "You did your duty, the voice whispered. Their weakness killed them, not you.",
      "But Cassian looked at his father—really looked—and saw the lie beneath the words. It wasn’t weakness that killed those farmers. It was power. Power that corrupted everyone who touched it, that convinced good men to do terrible things and called it necessity.",
      "“I’d rather be weak than be this.”",
      "He turned and walked toward the door.",
      "“If you leave,” the King said quietly, “you cannot come back. The shame of a prince who abandoned his duty will poison everything you touch. Your brothers will suffer for your cowardice. Your mother’s memory will be tainted by your failure.”",
      "Cassian paused, hand on the door.",
      "“My mother taught me that strength without mercy is just cruelty wearing armor.” He didn’t turn around. “She would be ashamed of what I did. What you made me do.”",
      "“Marianne understood duty. She made the same choices I made. The same compromises.”",
      "“Then she was wrong too.”",
      "He pulled open the door.",
      "“Cassian.”",
      "Something in the King’s voice made him stop. Not command—something rawer. Almost like pain.",
      "“If you walk through that door, you walk alone. No resources, no protection, no name. Everyone who knew you will believe you’re dead or disgraced. You’ll have nothing.”",
      "Cassian looked back over his shoulder. His father stood in the center of the study, arms at his sides, the most powerful man in the kingdom—and somehow, in this moment, utterly alone.",
      "“I’ll have my conscience.”",
      "“Conscience won’t keep you warm at night. Won’t feed you when you’re hungry. Won’t save you when your enemies come calling.”",
      "“Maybe not.” Cassian stepped through the door. “But at least I’ll be able to live with myself.”",
      "Three nights later, he boarded a cargo ship in the dead of night.",
      "The dock was quiet—fog rolling in from the harbor, the city’s lights dim smears in the distance. He carried one bag and the clothes on his back. Everything else he’d left behind: the armor, the weapons, the title, the life. All of it abandoned like a snake shedding poisoned skin.",
      "The ship’s captain asked no questions. Cassian had paid triple the normal fare and given a false name, and in Greyport—where the ship was bound—false names were more common than real ones. The captain wanted money, not history. That suited Cassian fine.",
      "As the ship pulled away from the dock, he stood at the stern and watched the coast of Valdrath shrink into the fog. The palace was invisible from here, but he knew where it stood—could picture his father’s study, his brothers’ chambers, his mother’s empty room that no one had touched since her death.",
      "Take care of them, she’d whispered in those final moments, her hand cold in his, her eyes already seeing something beyond this world. All of them. Promise me.",
      "“I tried,” Cassian said to the fog. “I tried, and I failed, and now I’m running because I can’t be the weapon he wants me to be.”",
      "The coastline disappeared.",
      "Cassian turned away from his homeland, from his family, from everything he’d ever known, and faced the open sea.",
      "He was twenty-three years old.",
      "He would spend the next twelve years trying to forget what he’d done.",
      "He would fail.",
      "Twelve years later, a letter would arrive:",
      "Crown Prince Aldric has fallen.",
      "You are commanded to return.",
      "And Cassian would learn that some debts cannot be outrun—only faced."

    "paragraphs": [
      "Seven soldiers surrounded an old woman in the church parking lot.",
      "Cassian saw them through the rain—dark uniforms, royal bronze, weapons at their hips. Mrs. Chen’s back was pressed against the stone wall, her grey hair plastered to her skull, and one of the soldiers was shouting about taxes while another kicked her purse across the wet asphalt.",
      "Keep walking. This isn’t your fight.",
      "He’d spent twelve years building that mantra into his bones. Twelve years of invisibility, of being nobody, of pretending the prince inside him had died. The rain dripped from his collar as he stood frozen mid-step, watching Mrs. Chen’s receipts dissolve in a puddle while soldiers laughed.",
      "You swore you’d never do this again.",
      "But she looked so small against that wall. So helpless. And the soldiers wore his family’s colors—crimson and bronze, the uniform of men who took what they wanted because strength was the only law that mattered in Valdrath.",
      "Sunday service had ended twenty minutes ago, but Cassian had lingered in the back pew until the sanctuary emptied. He always did. The Church of the Eternal Blade felt safer when it was just him and the flickering forge-light and the silence of a God who never answered. Tonight the prayers had felt especially hollow. He’d knelt on worn wood, lips moving through the Warrior’s Litany, and felt nothing but the familiar ache of guilt that twelve years of confession couldn’t absolve.",
      "Mrs. Chen had taught him to fold dumplings last winter. Her small hands guiding his through the delicate motion of sealing the edges, patient with his clumsiness. “Food made with care,” she’d said, “feeds more than the body.”",
      "She’d never asked about his scars. Never asked about the darkness that sometimes surfaced behind his eyes. She’d simply accepted him as Thomas Thorne, a quiet mechanic who kept to himself.",
      "Now glass shattered—her car window—and she cried out, a sound of pure terror that cut through the rain.",
      "Cassian turned.",
      "Seven soldiers. Standard intimidation formation—he recognized it from training sessions he’d rather forget. They’d pushed Mrs. Chen against the stone wall, blocking any retreat.",
      "One held a tablet, scrolling through data with the bureaucratic detachment of a man who’d learned to see people as numbers. Another had shattered the window of Mrs. Chen’s ancient sedan—a Toyota that had probably been old when she bought it—now speckled with rain-jeweled glass. Her purse lay open on the wet ground, contents scattered—a jade compact, a faded photograph, prescription bottles for medications Cassian couldn’t name.",
      "“That’s my car!” Mrs. Chen clutched her purse like a shield, her small frame trembling against the stone. “You can’t—I’ve done nothing wrong. I’ve lived here for forty years. I’ve paid every tax, every fee, every—”",
      "“We can do whatever we want, grandmother.” The lead soldier stepped forward, boot splashing in a puddle that reflected his sneering face. Young, probably mid-twenties, with the kind of expression that came from never being told no—from growing up with power and never learning what it cost. His insignia marked him as a sergeant, low enough to be hungry, high enough to be dangerous. “This is official business. Taxes are owed.”",
      "“I paid! I have the receipts—I keep everything, I’ve always kept everything—” Her hands shook as she fumbled with her purse, rain plastering her grey hair to her skull. She looked so small against the wall, so fragile. She looked like his mother had, near the end, when the bleeding wouldn’t stop and there was nothing anyone could do.",
      "“Then produce them. Now.”",
      "Mrs. Chen’s hands wouldn’t cooperate. Fear had taken her dexterity, stolen the steadiness that let her fold dumplings with surgical precision. Papers spilled onto the wet ground—receipts, probably, records she’d meticulously kept because she’d learned long ago that the poor had to prove their innocence in ways the wealthy never did.",
      "The soldier kicked them aside, documents scattering into puddles, ink running in the rain. “Looks like you can’t find them. Unfortunate. Property it is, then.”",
      "The other soldiers laughed. One of them—tall, with a crooked nose that suggested he’d been in fights before—made a crude comment about what else they might collect. Another reached for Mrs. Chen’s arm.",
      "Cassian was moving before he made a conscious decision.",
      "Twelve years of careful invisibility, and here he was walking straight toward trouble. Like the prince who’d questioned his father’s orders. Like the soldier who’d hesitated at the worst possible moment and let seven farmers die.",
      "But Mrs. Chen was crying, and somewhere deep inside Cassian something cracked open that twelve years hadn’t sealed shut.",
      "“She doesn’t owe you anything.”",
      "Seven heads turned. The soldiers assessed him with the quick, practiced evaluation of men trained to categorize threats—wet jacket, work boots, grease under his fingernails, calloused hands. Just another Greyport laborer, one of the countless working poor who populated this industrial district. Nothing special. Nothing dangerous.",
      "They were wrong.",
      "“This isn’t your business, citizen.” The lead soldier’s voice carried the casual contempt of a man addressing someone beneath his notice. “Walk away. Go home. Forget you saw anything.”",
      "“I’m making it my business.”",
      "The air changed. The other soldiers straightened, hands moving to weapons without conscious thought. They recognized his bearing now—the way he stood, weight balanced on the balls of his feet, shoulders loose, hands visible but ready. Not a laborer. Not entirely. This was how warriors stood, how killers stood. This was the posture of a man who’d been trained to fight since he could walk and had never entirely forgotten the lessons.",
      "“You want to do this the hard way?” The leader’s hand moved to the baton at his belt, a modern polymer truncheon that could shatter bone with the right application of force. “Seven to one, old man. Those aren’t good odds.”",
      "Old man. Cassian almost smiled. He was forty-three—old for Greyport, where hard labor aged you fast, but young for what he’d been. Princes of Valdrath could fight until their sixties, their bodies maintained by the best training and nutrition the kingdom could provide. Even now, rusty and out of practice, Cassian knew he was faster than any of these soldiers. Stronger. More skilled.",
      "More deadly.",
      "“I want you to leave an old woman alone.”",
      "“And if we don’t?”",
      "Cassian looked at Mrs. Chen. Saw the terror in her eyes—the wide, uncomprehending fear of someone who’d spent her whole life following the rules and was learning, too late, that rules only protected the powerful. The helplessness of age and poverty and the terrible vulnerability of being alone against forces that didn’t care whether you lived or died.",
      "He’d seen that look before. In another life.",
      "Seven farmers. Kneeling in the mud.",
      "They’d looked at him with the same desperate hope that the sword wouldn’t fall. He’d been twenty-three, dressed in ceremonial armor, his father’s order ringing in his ears: “Execute them. For the crime of rebellion.”",
      "They hadn’t rebelled. They’d petitioned for fair grain prices, which was their right. But Lord Evander wanted their land, and the King wanted Evander’s support, and seven farmers had knelt in the mud while a prince who’d never hurt anyone tried to remember how to swing a sword.",
      "His body remembered. Seven farmers had died, and Cassian had run, and now here he was—seven soldiers, rain, and the symmetry was almost poetic in its cruelty.",
      "The old wound on his throat pulsed with his heartbeat.",
      "“Then we’re going to have a problem.”",
      "The leader laughed, a harsh sound that echoed off the church walls. “Boys, looks like we’ve got a hero. Haven’t seen one of these in a while. What do you think—does he know what heroes end up looking like after we’re done with them?”",
      "The other soldiers grinned. One cracked his knuckles. Another pulled his baton, testing its weight.",
      "Cassian removed his jacket. Dropped it on the wet asphalt, where it landed with a heavy splat, rain immediately soaking into the fabric.",
      "“What are you—”",
      "He pulled his shirt over his head.",
      "Rain hit his bare skin like ice, thousands of tiny pinpricks running down his chest and back. Under the parking lot’s sodium lights, his torso was a map of violence—terrain of raised tissue and faded wounds that told a story no one in Greyport had ever heard.",
      "The massive diagonal scar from left shoulder to right hip, where an assassin’s blade had nearly bisected him when he was nineteen. The three bullet wounds on his ribs, clustered like a constellation, from the siege of Broken Ridge when his battalion had been overrun. The knife marks on his forearms, too many to count, layered like tree rings—training scars, dueling scars, the accumulated evidence of a life spent learning to harm. The thin line across his throat where someone had tried to end him and very nearly succeeded.",
      "And the brand on his shoulder. The Stormborn crest, seared into his flesh when he was six years old, marking him forever as a prince of Valdrath.",
      "The soldiers went quiet. Even the rain seemed to hush.",
      "“Mother’s mercy,” one whispered. The youngest, barely old enough to shave, his baton lowering as if he’d forgotten he was holding it. “Who is this guy?”",
      "The leader recovered faster than the others—credit to his training, if nothing else. His sneer returned, though it wavered at the edges. “Doesn’t matter how many scars you’ve got. There’s seven of us and one of you. Scars just mean you’ve been hurt before. Means you can be hurt again.”",
      "Seven. The sacred number—seven days of forging, seven virtues of the warrior, seven trials before a man could be called true. Cassian almost laughed. The Divine Smith had a dark sense of humor.",
      "“Then you should feel confident.”",
      "The leader moved first—leaders always did, couldn’t afford to look hesitant. Fast, trained, the baton describing a clean arc toward Cassian’s temple. A good strike. The kind that would have put a normal man on the ground, skull cracked, fight over.",
      "Cassian’s body remembered what his mind had tried to forget.",
      "He slipped the strike, pivoting on his left foot, letting the baton whisper past his ear close enough to feel the wind of its passage. His right hand caught the soldier’s extended arm at the wrist, fingers finding the pressure point without conscious thought. His left hand came up under the elbow. He twisted.",
      "The pop of the dislocating shoulder was barely audible over the rain, but the leader’s scream more than made up for it. He collapsed, cradling his ruined arm, and Cassian was already moving, already flowing into the next engagement like water finding its level.",
      "The others rushed him. No coordination, no tactics—just seven men (six now, minus the leader writhing on the ground) converging on a single target with the assumption that numbers would do what skill could not. They were wrong.",
      "Time slowed—not the romantic way poets described, moments stretching like taffy. This was mechanical, cold, each moving part of him clicking into terrible precision. Cassian’s awareness expanded, taking in positions and trajectories and threat levels with the cold clarity of a man who’d survived a hundred battles by never letting himself feel any of them.",
      "Soldier two swung wide, his baton coming in on a horizontal arc that would have caught a slower man in the ribs. Cassian ducked under, felt the weapon pass through the space where his head had been, and drove his elbow into the man’s solar plexus with all the force of his rising momentum. The soldier’s breath exploded out of him in a single gasp—the sound of lungs emptying all at once—and he dropped, gasping, drowning in air that wouldn’t come.",
      "Soldier three had a knife. Bad idea. Knives were intimate weapons, requiring close quarters and commitment, and the soldier had neither the training nor the temperament for blade work. He lunged with too much aggression and not enough control, telegraphing his target by staring directly at Cassian’s throat. Cassian caught the wrist, redirected the blade, and used the man’s own momentum to send him face-first into the pavement. His nose shattered on impact—Cassian heard the crack, felt the vibration through the man’s arm—and blood began pooling on the wet asphalt, mixing with the rain.",
      "Four and five attacked together. Coordinated, at least—they’d trained together, knew each other’s rhythms. Four came high while five went low, a pincer movement that would have worked against most opponents. Cassian stepped back, just far enough to let them tangle with each other, and when four stumbled into five’s path, Cassian snapped a kick into the outside of four’s knee. The joint buckled sideways with a sound like a branch breaking. Four collapsed screaming, clutching a leg that would never work quite right again, and five hesitated—just for a moment, just long enough for instinct to override training.",
      "Fatal mistake.",
      "Cassian’s palm strike caught him in the sternum, driving upward with enough force to lift the man off his feet. Five flew backward, arms pinwheeling, and crashed into what remained of Mrs. Chen’s car window. More glass shattered, and he lay still among the fragments, breath coming in shallow, pained gasps.",
      "Six tried to run.",
      "Cassian caught him in three steps—his legs remembered sprinting, remembered the pursuit, remembered that fleeing enemies became threats if you let them escape. He swept the soldier’s legs, bore him to the ground, pinned him with a knee to the back. “Stay down.” Quiet, almost gentle. “You don’t have to die tonight.”",
      "Six whimpered and went still.",
      "Seven—the youngest, the one who’d whispered about Mother’s mercy—stood frozen. His baton trembled in his grip, the weapon shaking so badly he could barely hold it. Tears mixed with rain on his face. He was maybe nineteen, maybe twenty. Young enough to have joined the army for the steady pay and the respect of the uniform, too young to have learned that uniforms didn’t make you safe.",
      "“Your choice,” Cassian said quietly.",
      "The baton clattered to the ground. The boy raised his hands and began to cry in earnest, great heaving sobs that shook his whole body.",
      "Seven opponents. Less than three minutes. None dead.",
      "Cassian stood in the rain, chest heaving, blood from someone else’s split lip mixing with the water on his knuckles. The violence had come so easily—like slipping into a native tongue after years of speaking something foreign. Every lesson, every drill, every brutal hour in the training yards. His father would have been proud.",
      "You’re a monster. You always were.",
      "The King had said that during their final argument. “You think running makes you moral? You are what I forged you to be, Cassian. A blade. You cannot unforgive steel.”",
      "Mrs. Chen stared at him from the church wall. The terror hadn’t left her face—if anything, it had deepened.",
      "“Mr. Thorne…” Her voice trembled. “What are you?”",
      "Cassian bent to pick up his shirt. His hands were shaking now—delayed reaction, adrenaline crash, guilt flooding through the dam he’d built against it. All the emotions he hadn’t let himself feel during the fight rushed in at once, a tsunami of self-loathing that nearly drove him to his knees.",
      "“Someone who should have stayed inside.”",
      "He pulled the wet fabric over his head, covering the scars, the brand, the evidence of who he really was. The shirt clung to his skin, cold and uncomfortable, but it was armor of a kind. Cloth between himself and the world. Invisibility, reclaimed.",
      "You can never undo what you are, his father’s voice whispered. You can only bury it. And buried things have a way of rising.",
      "A light flickered in the church doorway. Father Matthias stood there, backlit by the forge-glow from the sanctuary, his white robes stained amber by the sacred flames. He was seventy-one years old, missing his left arm below the elbow—lost to a combat trial decades ago, before he’d found the priesthood—and his face held an expression Cassian had never seen there.",
      "Recognition. Sorrow. Something that might have been hope.",
      "“Cassian.” Not the name on his fake ID, the carefully constructed identity of Thomas Thorne, mechanic. His real name. The name of a prince, a killer, an exile. “We need to talk.”",
      "Cassian’s blood went cold. Twelve years of hiding, twelve years of pretending, twelve years of building a life that was supposed to be ordinary—and it all crumbled with a single word.",
      "“The police—”",
      "“Won’t be coming. These men were acting without authorization—I’ve already contacted the local magistrate. Rogue collection, they call it. The Crown will disavow them.” Matthias stepped back into the church, his single arm gesturing toward the interior. “Come inside. There’s a messenger waiting.”",
      "A messenger.",
      "Cassian looked at the groaning soldiers, scattered across the parking lot like debris from a storm. At Mrs. Chen, still pressed against the wall, her terror slowly transforming into something else—wonder, maybe, or the beginning of understanding. At his own hands, which had just done in three minutes what twelve years of peace couldn’t undo.",
      "“It’s all right,” Mrs. Chen said softly, her voice steadier than he expected. “Go. I’ll be fine.”",
      "He didn’t believe her. He wasn’t fine, and he’d been the one dealing out violence, not receiving it. The night would haunt her—the fear, the helplessness, the discovery that the quiet mechanic who fixed her car was something altogether different.",
      "But he walked toward the church anyway, because Father Matthias knew his name, and that meant everything was about to change. The rain plastered his hair to his skull as he climbed the steps, each footfall heavy with the weight of a destiny he’d tried to escape.",
      "The sanctuary doors closed behind him with a sound like a tomb sealing shut.",
      "The sanctuary smelled like smoke and iron and sacred oils. The Church of the Eternal Blade wasn’t ornate—a working-class parish where faith was something you clung to because the alternative was despair—but it had weight. History in the stones.",
      "Cassian followed Father Matthias past the altar, through a narrow corridor he’d never entered, to a small office cramped with books and papers. A single lamp burned on the desk.",
      "A woman sat in the corner chair. Royal colors—crimson and bronze. Sharp features, dark hair cropped short, eyes that tracked him with military precision.",
      "“Prince Cassian Stormborn,” she said.",
      "The name drove the air from his lungs. Twelve years of hiding, and a single word had collapsed it all.",
      "“You have the wrong person.”",
      "“I don’t.” She stood—tall, fluid, dangerous. “Captain Sera. Royal messenger corps. I’ve been looking for you for six weeks.”",
      "“Then you wasted your time.”",
      "“Did I?” She glanced toward the window, the sounds of the parking lot filtering through—groaning soldiers, approaching sirens. “Seven soldiers in three minutes. That’s not a mechanic’s work. That’s a prince’s.”",
      "Matthias settled behind his desk, single hand folded before him. Of course he’d known. The priest who heard confessions for a living, who’d been a warrior himself—of course he’d seen through the disguise.",
      "“Sit down, Cassian.”",
      "“You knew.” Hollow. Scraped. “All these years.”",
      "“Since your third week. You’re not as good at hiding as you think.” His eyes were kind but unyielding. “Did you really believe I wouldn’t recognize Marianne’s son? Your mother and I served in the same battalion.”",
      "Marianne.",
      "Her name, spoken aloud for the first time in years. Thinking about her meant thinking about the blood and the nursery and the baby crying and the promise he’d failed to keep.",
      "Take care of them. All of them.",
      "Cassian sat. The adrenaline crash had left him weak. The chair creaked under his weight.",
      "“What do you want?” he asked Captain Sera.",
      "“Nothing. I’m just the messenger.” She pulled an envelope from her jacket—thick paper, heavy vellum, the kind only the palace used. Royal seal in crimson wax, the Stormborn crest pressed into it with the clarity of fresh creation. A blade crossed with a hammer, the sigil of his house. His family’s mark. His father’s claim on him. “This is what wants you.”",
      "He didn’t take it. Couldn’t make himself reach for it, as if touching the envelope would make everything real in a way it wasn’t yet.",
      "“How did Aldric die?”",
      "The question stopped her. Something flickered across her face—pain, quickly suppressed, but real enough that Cassian caught it. Aldric had meant something to her. More than duty, more than service.",
      "“You heard?”",
      "“News coverage. Three days ago.” He’d been walking past a screen in a store window, the evening after his shift at the shop, and the words had frozen him mid-step. CROWN PRINCE ALDRIC DEAD. VALDRATH IN MOURNING. He’d stood there for ten minutes, maybe fifteen, waiting for it to be a mistake. Waiting for someone to laugh and say it was a joke, a test, a hoax. His brother. His perfect, golden, unstoppable brother. Dead. It wasn’t possible. It wasn’t—",
      "“Combat trial.” Sera’s voice dropped. “Challenge Right. A foreign prince disputed territorial claims—standard procedure. Aldric could have sent a champion, but he never delegated anything. He accepted, as was his nature.”",
      "“And?”",
      "“His blade broke.”",
      "The room swayed. He gripped the armrests.",
      "“Aldric’s blade doesn’t break.”",
      "“It did.”",
      "“Royal steel. Forged by Garret Ironhand. Folded a thousand times.” Cassian could see it in memory—beautiful, deadly, an extension of his brother’s arm. He’d watched Aldric train with it for years. “It doesn’t break. It can’t break.”",
      "“And yet.” Something flickered in her eyes—rage or grief or both. “The foreign prince’s counterstrike took him in the throat. He died on the sacred sand, in front of ten thousand witnesses.”",
      "She stopped. Swallowed.",
      "“He’s dead, and you’re summoned home.”",
      "Cassian stared at his hands. Mechanic’s hands now—calloused from labor, stained with grease that never quite washed out, nails torn from working on engines and transmissions and the honest machinery of ordinary life. But beneath the surface, still killer’s hands. Still the hands that had executed seven farmers on his father’s orders. Still the hands that had just disabled seven soldiers in a church parking lot.",
      "“The foreign prince?”",
      "“Left Valdrath immediately after. Diplomatic immunity—he was on a ship before the body cooled. Haven’t been able to locate him since.” Sera’s jaw tightened. “The Shadow Guard is looking. Prince Lucian’s people. But it’s been three days, and nothing.”",
      "“And the blade?”",
      "“Destroyed.” The word came out flat, bitter. “Royal order. The King said examining it would be an insult to Aldric’s memory. Like his sword was a corpse, and we were desecrating it.”",
      "Destroyed. Evidence, eliminated. A prince, vanished. A death too convenient to be accident.",
      "Cassian knew what this looked like. Twelve years away from the palace hadn’t made him forget how the game was played. Someone had arranged his brother’s death. Someone with access to royal weapons, information about the combat trial, connections to a foreign prince willing to play the role of executioner. Someone still in Valdrath, protected, watching.",
      "“I’m not going back.”",
      "Sera’s jaw tightened. “It’s not a request, my lord. It’s a royal summons. The King’s own seal. Refusal is treason.”",
      "“Then arrest me for treason.” He met her eyes, letting her see the darkness there, the thing he’d spent twelve years trying to bury. “I’ve earned worse.”",
      "“Cassian.” Matthias’s voice, gentle but firm, the voice that had guided him through confession after confession, never judging, never condemning. “Listen to me.”",
      "“I can’t face them.” The words came out before he could stop them, raw and honest in a way he rarely allowed himself. “I can’t face him. The King. After everything—after what he made me do—”",
      "“You just fought seven men to defend an old woman.” Matthias leaned forward, his single hand flat on the desk. “You risked everything—your anonymity, your safety, your new life—because an elderly stranger was crying in a parking lot. You can face your family.”",
      "Cassian laughed. It came out cracked, bitter, the sound of a man who’d stopped believing in himself long ago. “The men were easier. The men were simple. Hit them, put them down, walk away. My family—” He shook his head. “My family is a maze with no exit.”",
      "Silence fell over the small office. The rain drummed against the windows, a steady percussion that seemed to mark time, counting down to something inevitable. Somewhere outside, the sirens had stopped—either arrived or diverted, it didn’t matter which.",
      "Sera stood. “You have two days to settle your affairs. Then we leave. The airship will be at the northern port, dawn, third day.” She moved toward the door, paused with her hand on the frame. “For what it’s worth, I knew your brother. Personally. He spoke of you often. He would have wanted you there.”",
      "She left. The sound of her boots receding down the corridor mixed with the rain and the crackle of the forge-light, and then there was silence.",
      "Cassian and Matthias sat in the lamplight, the envelope lying on the desk between them like an unexploded bomb. The old priest didn’t speak. He was good at silence—it was one of the things Cassian had always appreciated about him. No platitudes, no pressure. Just presence. Just witness.",
      "“Do you think God forgives us?” Cassian asked finally. “For what we are?”",
      "Matthias considered. His remaining hand—scarred, age-spotted, the hand of a warrior turned priest—tapped slowly on the desk. The brand on his own shoulder, hidden beneath his robes, probably ached in the cold. All the old veterans felt their marks when the weather turned.",
      "“I think,” he said slowly, “the Divine Smith forges us in fire and expects us to become blades, not ash. The question isn’t whether He forgives. The question is what you choose to cut.”",
      "“And if I’ve already cut the wrong things?”",
      "“Then you choose better, next time.” Matthias leaned forward, his eyes intense with decades of faith and failure and hard-won wisdom. “You’ve been running for twelve years, son. Maybe it’s time to stop.”",
      "“Running kept me alive.”",
      "“Did it? Or did it keep you from living?”",
      "The question hung in the air like smoke from the sanctuary braziers. Cassian had no answer. He’d told himself for so long that exile was survival, that anonymity was safety, that becoming someone else was the only way to escape the monster he’d been. But sitting here, in the aftermath of violence he’d sworn to abandon, he wasn’t sure anymore. He wasn’t sure of anything.",
      "He pushed to his feet. His body ached—the fight was catching up with him, muscles remembering what it cost to hurt people, joints protesting movements they hadn’t made in years. He moved to the window, looked out at the parking lot. The soldiers were being loaded into an ambulance now, official vehicles having arrived at some point while he wasn’t paying attention. Mrs. Chen’s car sat alone in the rain, one window shattered, papers dissolving in a puddle.",
      "“My mother,” he said. “She died in my arms. Did you know that?”",
      "“Yes.” Matthias’s voice was soft. “I received word, after. I lit a candle for her. I’ve lit one every year since.”",
      "“She made me promise. The last thing she ever said to me. Take care of them. All of them.” His voice broke slightly, the wall around his grief cracking for just a moment. “I couldn’t. I tried, and I couldn’t, and I ran. If I go back now—”",
      "“You’ll have to face what you left behind.”",
      "“They’ll hate me.”",
      "“Some will. Others won’t.” Matthias stood, moved to stand beside him, his single arm resting on the windowsill. “Your youngest brother, Theo. He was five when you left. He’s seventeen now. According to certain records I’ve… acquired… he’s spent years trying to understand why you fled. He doesn’t hate you, Cassian. He wants to know you.”",
      "Theo. The baby in the nurse’s arms while their mother bled out on the birthing bed. The child whose first breaths had been accompanied by their mother’s last. Cassian hadn’t let himself think about Theo in years—the guilt was too heavy, the failure too profound. He should have stayed. Should have raised his brother, protected him, been there for the thousand moments that made a childhood. Instead, he’d run, and Theo had grown up without a mother or a second brother.",
      "“And the King?”",
      "Matthias’s silence was answer enough.",
      "“Right.” Cassian turned from the window. “Two days?”",
      "“Two days.”",
      "He walked to the door, paused. The envelope from Captain Sera was still on the desk, the royal seal gleaming in the lamplight. He picked it up without thinking, tucked it into his pocket. He didn’t open it. He didn’t need to.",
      "“Thank you. For keeping my secret.”",
      "“Thank you for giving this parish twelve years of a good man.” Matthias smiled slightly, the expression carving new lines into his weathered face. “Even if he didn’t believe he was one.”",
      "Cassian left without responding. What could he say? He didn’t believe. He never had. Every Sunday, every prayer, every confession—it was all performance, a man going through the motions of faith because the alternative was admitting that the universe was cold and empty and didn’t care whether you lived or died or murdered farmers on your father’s orders.",
      "Outside, the rain had slowed to a drizzle. He stood on the church steps, looking up at the grey sky, feeling the water on his face like penance. The ambulance was pulling away, carrying the soldiers to the hospital. Mrs. Chen was nowhere to be seen—probably inside, giving a statement, processing what she’d witnessed. The parking lot looked abandoned, scattered with glass and blood and the aftermath of violence he’d promised himself he’d never commit again.",
      "His brother was dead. The King commanded his return.",
      "And somewhere in Valdrath, someone had murdered the Crown Prince and gotten away with it.",
      "Take care of them. All of them.",
      "His mother’s voice, twelve years dead, echoing in his skull.",
      "“Damn it,” Cassian whispered to the rain.",
      "He walked to his truck, the envelope heavy in his pocket, the jade pendant Mrs. Chen had given him earlier in the week pressing against his chest beneath his wet shirt. His keys were wet, his hands were shaking, and the engine took three tries to turn over because the ignition was going bad and he’d never gotten around to fixing it.",
      "Two days. Then everything he’d built, everything he’d run from, everything he’d tried to bury—",
      "It was all coming back.",
      "And this time, there was nowhere left to run.",
      "He drove home through empty streets, the city gray and wet around him.",
      "His apartment above the laundromat was dark. Three rooms. Secondhand furniture. A photograph of his mother on the nightstand—creased, faded, the only link to his past he’d kept.",
      "It wasn’t much. But it was his.",
      "And now you have to leave it.",
      "He didn’t sleep. He sat by the window, watching the rain, thinking about seven farmers and seven soldiers and a brother who’d died on sacred sand.",
      "Tomorrow, he would begin saying goodbye.",
      "The day after, he would go home.",
      "And then, God help him, he would have to become the prince he’d spent twelve years trying to forget."

      "Three Days Earlier",
      "The pyre burned like a fallen sun.",
      "Crown Prince Aldric Stormborn—the Golden Son, the Undefeated—reduced to ash while ten thousand mourners wept.",
      "Not Edric. He was done with tears.",
      "He’d wept that first night, alone in darkness, grieving for someone he’d loved and hated in equal measure. His brother. His rival. The golden obstacle who’d stood between him and everything he wanted.",
      "Now there was nothing left but calculation.",
      "The Grand Plaza stretched before them, black-clad nobles packed shoulder to shoulder. The plaza had been built four thousand years ago by their ancestor, Aldric the First. Blood had soaked these stones during the wars of consolidation.",
      "Fitting that they should burn their Aldric here.",
      "The pyre had been constructed from sacred oak, drenched in blessed oils. Aldric’s body lay in full battle regalia, gold-chased steel catching the firelight. His hands were crossed over his chest, and upon them lay the broken sword.",
      "Broken.",
      "The word circled in Edric’s mind. Aldric’s blade, forged by Garret Ironhand, tempered in traditions older than the dynasty.",
      "It wasn’t supposed to break. Nothing about this was supposed to happen.",
      "Aldric had been thirty-five years old. Invincible. Untouchable. The kind of man who made you believe in destiny just by standing in the same room. And now he was burning on a pyre, his sword in pieces, his throat cut open by a foreign prince who’d vanished like smoke before the body had even cooled.",
      "Edric forced his attention to his father.",
      "King Daveth stood at the foot of the pyre, carved from stone. He wore the ceremonial robes of state—crimson and bronze, heavy with gold thread, the weight of five thousand years of dynasty pressing down on his shoulders. His face was a mask, unreadable as the granite beneath his feet. No tears. No expression. Just… nothing. Thirty-five years on the throne, and Edric had never once seen his father cry. Not when Mother died, bleeding out in the nursery while baby Theo screamed. Not when Cassian fled into the night, abandoning his family and his duty. Not now, watching his firstborn burn.",
      "He’s already weighing options. Deciding who rises, who falls, who can be used.",
      "The thought should have shamed Edric. It didn’t.",
      "The King’s eyes moved across his remaining sons, and Edric felt that gaze like a blade against his throat—measuring, assessing, finding him wanting. Daveth had never hidden his preferences. Aldric was the golden heir, the warrior without flaw. Cassian had been the passionate failure, too soft for what the throne required. And the rest of them? Pieces on a board. Tools to be used.",
      "But Aldric is dead, Edric thought. And Cassian has been gone for twelve years. The board has changed, Father. Time to learn new games.",
      "He cataloged his brothers with the precision of a political negotiation.",
      "Vincent stood at rigid attention, jaw tight with fury barely contained. Fourth-born, the soldier. His hands were clenched at his sides, knuckles white. He processed grief as anger—always had. Right now, he looked like he wanted to murder someone.",
      "Good. Angry men were predictable.",
      "Marcus stood apart, pale and withdrawn, clutching an ancient text against his chest like a shield. Fifth-born, the intellectual. His eyes were red-rimmed, tear tracks visible. He’d loved Aldric in his way—argued with him constantly, lost every battle. Now he looked like a man robbed of something he couldn’t name.",
      "Too moral to be a threat. Useful for research. But he’ll never fight for the throne.",
      "Lucian was the one to watch.",
      "The sixth prince stood in perfect composure, platinum hair slicked back, ice-blue eyes tracking the crowd. When their gazes met, Lucian’s lips curved slightly. He knew Edric was watching. He was watching right back.",
      "Lucian commanded the Shadow Guard—spies, assassins, the darkness that polite society pretended didn’t exist. If anyone had information about Aldric’s death, it was him. If anyone had the means to arrange such a death…",
      "Edric filed away the possibility.",
      "Finally, there was Theo.",
      "Seventeen years old, still gangly, a boy in ceremonial robes. The youngest prince stood closest to the pyre, as tradition demanded, and wept without shame—the only honest emotion in the entire gathering.",
      "Innocent, Edric thought, and felt something like envy. Give him a few more years in this family, and he’ll learn to hide it like the rest of us.",
      "The flames climbed higher, and Aldric’s body was barely visible now, consumed by fire and smoke. The High Forge-Master chanted prayers from the ancient liturgy—something about the Divine Smith’s anvil, about souls tempered in the final flame, about warriors returning to the forge to be reborn. The words were supposed to be comforting. Edric had heard them at a dozen funerals, and they’d never comforted anyone.",
      "He was thinking about the throne.",
      "With Aldric dead, the succession was open. The King still ruled, of course—Daveth was sixty-seven, old for a warrior-king but not ancient. He might live another decade, or another twenty years, or die tomorrow. The point was that for the first time in thirty-five years, there was no clear heir.",
      "Technically, Cassian was second in line. The Second Prince, by order of birth. But Cassian had been in exile for twelve years, living under a false name in some industrial city across the sea. He’d fled his duties, his family, his birthright. If he didn’t return—and Edric doubted he would—then the next prince in line was…",
      "Him.",
      "Third son. Second now, if you don’t count the exile.",
      "But counting wasn’t crowning. The Warrior’s Code was clear: succession went by the King’s declaration, not by order of birth. Daveth could name any of his sons as heir, or none of them. He could elevate a nephew, a cousin, even a complete outsider if he chose. The throne went to the strongest, the most capable, the one who could hold it against all challengers.",
      "And the King hadn’t declared anyone yet.",
      "Protocol requires a year of deliberation, Edric reminded himself. A year of mourning before a new heir can be named. That gives us time. Time to position. Time to prove worth. Time to eliminate competition.",
      "The pyre collapsed inward with a shower of sparks, the sacred oak finally succumbing to the flames. Theo flinched, a strangled sound escaping his throat. Vincent didn’t move—he’d gone perfectly still, a statue in military uniform. Marcus closed his eyes, lips moving in silent prayer.",
      "Lucian caught Edric’s gaze again and inclined his head, barely perceptible.",
      "We need to talk, the gesture said.",
      "Edric agreed.",
      "The wake was held in the Great Hall—black marble columns, vaulted ceiling, five thousand years of royal history.",
      "Tonight it was dressed in mourning. The kingdom’s nobility had gathered to pay respects—or be seen paying respects. Dukes and counts, generals and admirals, all watching each other with the wariness of wolves at a disputed kill.",
      "Edric moved through the crowd with practiced ease.",
      "“My lord, my condolences.”",
      "“Thank you, Count Vestran. Your presence honors us.”",
      "“Prince Edric, if there’s anything my family can do—”",
      "“Your support means more than you know, Lady Corwin.”",
      "Politics didn’t pause for death. If anything, death accelerated it. Every noble in this room was already recalculating alliances, already wondering which prince would rise, which would fall, which could be cultivated and which should be avoided. Aldric’s death had reshuffled the deck, and everyone was trying to read the new cards.",
      "Edric played along. He knew how to play—it was the only game he’d ever been good at. Not a warrior like Vincent, not a scholar like Marcus, not a spymaster like Lucian. But a politician. A strategist. A man who understood that power came in many forms, and brute force was often the least useful of them.",
      "He found Lucian on the gallery overlooking the hall. His brother leaned against the balustrade, wine in hand, watching the mourners with detached interest.",
      "“Brother.” Velvet over ice. “How thoughtful of you to find me.”",
      "“We need to talk.”",
      "“Do we? About what? The weather? The fish course?” Lucian turned, ice-blue eyes glittering. “I noticed it was overcooked—disappointing, given the occasion.”",
      "“About succession.”",
      "Something flickered in Lucian’s eyes.",
      "“Dangerous word, Edric. Father’s barely finished mourning.”",
      "“Father’s never mourned anything in his life. He’s calculating. Same as us.” Edric stepped closer. “He won’t name an heir immediately. Protocol requires a year. That gives us time.”",
      "“Time for what?”",
      "“To determine what really happened to Aldric.”",
      "Lucian’s posture shifted—more alert. Like a cat spotting movement.",
      "“You think it wasn’t an accident.”",
      "“He was the finest duelist in the kingdom. His blade was forged by Garret Ironhand. He’d won dozens of Challenge Rights without a scratch.” Edric held his brother’s gaze. “And now he’s dead because his sword broke? I don’t believe in coincidences that convenient.”",
      "“Convenient for whom?”",
      "“That’s what I’d like to know.”",
      "They stared at each other—two brothers who understood each other better than either would admit.",
      "“You’re suggesting murder,” Lucian said.",
      "“I’m suggesting the possibility. You run the Shadow Guard. If Aldric was assassinated, you’d have the best chance of proving it.”",
      "“And why would I want to prove it?”",
      "“Because if someone killed him to claim the throne, they’ll kill again. You’re sixth in line. Not the most likely target, but not the safest either.”",
      "Lucian’s smile was cold. “I always know more than I’m saying. It’s the point of my position.”",
      "“Then share. We’re on the same side.”",
      "“Are we?” Lucian pushed off from the balustrade, moving with the fluid grace of a predator. “I’m not sure what side you’re on, Edric. The loyal brother, grieving his sibling? The ambitious politician, seizing opportunity? The reformer, hoping Aldric’s death creates the change you’ve always wanted?”",
      "“All of those. None of those.” Edric didn’t flinch from the assessment. “I want the truth. Whatever it costs.”",
      "“That’s a dangerous promise.” Lucian moved past him, toward the stairs. “But I’ll think about it. In the meantime, I’d suggest watching your back. If someone did kill Aldric, they’re not likely to stop at one.”",
      "“Lucian.”",
      "The sixth prince paused, one foot on the first step, looking back over his shoulder.",
      "“One more question.” Edric’s voice was soft, carrying only between them. “Do you know where Cassian is?”",
      "Silence stretched between them, laden with meaning. Lucian’s expression flickered—too fast to read, gone before Edric could interpret it.",
      "“Why do you ask?”",
      "“Because if Father sends for him—which he will, eventually—someone should warn him what he’s walking into.”",
      "Lucian’s laugh was quiet, humorless—snow falling on iron. “Warn him? Brother, if Cassian comes home, he’ll be walking into the same nest of vipers we all live in. The only question is whether he remembers how to bite back.”",
      "He descended the stairs and vanished into the crowd below, platinum hair catching the light for a moment before disappearing among the black-clad mourners.",
      "Edric stood alone on the gallery, watching his brothers move through the mourners like pieces on a board. Vincent with military officers. Marcus retreating with his books. Theo accepting sympathy from young nobles.",
      "And the King, standing alone before a portrait of Aldric, his back to the room.",
      "Everyone in this palace is a suspect.",
      "The game for the throne had already begun.",
      "And he intended to win.",
      "Later that night, Edric sat in his private chambers, staring at a map of the kingdom.",
      "Valdrath. Five thousand years of history, four thousand miles of territory, forty million souls. His birthright, if he could claim it. His burden, if he chose to bear it.",
      "The map was ancient—hand-painted on treated leather, preserved through centuries of careful maintenance. It showed the kingdom not as it was now, with its railways and telegraph lines and modern cities, but as it had been during the age of unification. Seven kingdoms, each with its own color, each with its own ruler, each doomed to be absorbed into the Stormborn Empire.",
      "Edric traced the borders with one finger, feeling the texture of the leather beneath his skin. He’d spent his life preparing for this moment—not for Aldric’s death, never that, but for the moment when his talents would be needed. When the kingdom would require something other than a perfect warrior, a golden prince, a hero from the ballads.",
      "He wasn’t the warrior Vincent was. He couldn’t lead armies or inspire men to die for a cause. He wasn’t the scholar Marcus was. He couldn’t recite history or quote philosophy or understand the deep currents of intellectual tradition that Marcus navigated so effortlessly. He wasn’t even the schemer Lucian was. He didn’t have spy networks or assassin cadres or the cold ruthlessness that made Lucian both invaluable and terrifying.",
      "But he was the one who understood how the pieces fit together.",
      "Armies and politics and economics and faith—they weren’t separate things, no matter how people pretended otherwise. They were threads in a single tapestry, each one affecting all the others. Pull on one thread, and the whole pattern shifted. Edric had spent thirty-three years learning to read that tapestry, to see the connections that others missed.",
      "He was the one who could see the whole board while his brothers focused on their own corners.",
      "I could be a good king, he thought. Better than Aldric would have been. Not because I’m stronger or smarter or more virtuous. Because I understand that kingship isn’t about strength alone.",
      "The thought was treason. He didn’t care.",
      "Aldric had been perfect—too perfect. He’d never failed, never struggled, never doubted. He’d seen the warrior code as a tool for maintaining power, not a moral framework. His reforms would have concentrated authority in the crown, ending the Challenge Right entirely, making the Stormborn Dynasty absolute in a way it had never been before.",
      "Edric had opposed those reforms quietly, through whispers and subtle maneuvering. He’d believed in tradition—not blind tradition, but the kind that balanced power, that kept any one person from becoming a tyrant. The Challenge Right was brutal, yes. But it also meant that even the King could be held accountable, that strength was tested rather than assumed.",
      "Aldric had wanted to end that. Had wanted a kingdom where the Crown answered to no one.",
      "And now Aldric was dead, and those reforms had died with him.",
      "Unless.",
      "Unless someone else revived them. Unless whoever killed Aldric was part of a larger faction, pursuing the same ends through different means. Unless the conspiracy was about more than just removing one prince—unless it was about reshaping the entire kingdom.",
      "Edric pulled a sheet of paper toward him. Began writing names.",
      "Lord Evander. Aldric’s biggest supporter. A progressive noble who’d funded the reform movement, pushed for centralization, dreamed of a modern Valdrath free from ancient traditions. Wealthy, connected, ruthless in his pursuit of what he called “progress.” He’d benefited enormously from Aldric’s patronage. Would he kill his own ally? Perhaps, if Aldric was having second thoughts. Perhaps, if there was a better candidate to support.",
      "General Vance. Commander of the Eastern Legion, second only to Vincent in military authority. An ally of Evander’s, rumored to support drastic change. He’d clashed with the King more than once over questions of military reform. Ambitious, patient, and very, very dangerous.",
      "Chancellor Morin. Edric’s own mentor, ironically. A moderate reformer who believed in gradual change, in working within the system rather than overthrowing it. But would he resort to murder if gradual change proved impossible? Morin was old, his time running out. Desperate men did desperate things.",
      "Lucian himself. The Shadow Guard captain had access, means, and motivation. Sixth sons didn’t inherit unless many brothers died first. And Lucian had always been cold, calculating, willing to do what was necessary. He claimed to serve the Crown, but whose crown? The one on Father’s head, or one he hoped to wear himself?",
      "Edric stared at the list. Four names. Dozens more could be added. The conspiracy—if there was one—could be large or small, obvious or invisible.",
      "He needed more information. He needed someone with no stake in the outcome, no ambition for the throne, no loyalty to any faction.",
      "He needed Cassian.",
      "The exile. The second son who ran away. The only one of us who doesn’t want power.",
      "Edric had followed his brother’s whereabouts over the years, through sources that had nothing to do with the Shadow Guard. Merchant contacts who’d passed through Greyport. Private investigators hired under assumed names. Careful inquiries that never triggered Lucian’s network of spies.",
      "He knew Cassian was in Greyport, an industrial city across the sea. Knew he worked as a mechanic, fixing engines and transmissions in a shop owned by a man named Merrick. Knew he attended church every Sunday, a parish called the Church of the Eternal Blade. Knew he lived a quiet, unremarkable life, the kind of existence that seemed impossible for someone born to rule.",
      "If he comes back, he’ll be neutral. Everyone will underestimate him—the exile, the failure, the prince who ran. And he’s still the best fighter any of us has ever seen.",
      "Cassian had been twenty-three when he fled, already legendary among the warrior class. He’d beaten Aldric in the training yards more than once, though Aldric had never admitted it publicly. He’d survived assassination attempts that should have killed him. He’d commanded men who would have died for him without hesitation.",
      "And then he’d murdered seven farmers on the King’s orders, and something inside him had broken, and he’d vanished into the night.",
      "Edric made a decision.",
      "He would send word to the King, suggesting Cassian be summoned. He would frame it as duty, as tradition—the second son should attend his brother’s funeral rites, regardless of exile. The King would agree because it served his own purposes, whatever those might be.",
      "And then, when Cassian arrived, Edric would approach him. Offer alliance. Use him to investigate what really happened. Cassian had always been good at finding truth, even when the truth was ugly. Perhaps especially when it was ugly.",
      "And if the investigation points somewhere I don’t want it to?",
      "Edric pushed the thought aside. He’d deal with that when it happened. For now, he needed to focus on what he could control: positioning himself, gathering allies, eliminating threats.",
      "He looked at the map again. At Valdrath, spread out before him like a prize waiting to be claimed.",
      "Aldric is dead. Cassian is gone. Vincent doesn’t want the throne. Marcus can’t fight for it. Lucian… Lucian is dangerous, but he can be outmaneuvered.",
      "That leaves Theo and Father.",
      "Theo was a child. Seventeen, naive, inexperienced. He’d need years of training before he could even contemplate ruling. Father was old, stubborn, and—according to certain rumors Edric had heard—possibly ill. Neither was an insurmountable obstacle.",
      "I can do this, Edric thought. I can claim what should be mine.",
      "He began writing letters. To allies. To potential supporters. To people who owed him favors. The night was long, and there was much to do.",
      "The game had begun.",
      "And Edric intended to win.",
      "On the other side of the palace, Lucian stood in his private quarters, staring at a dossier marked with Cassian’s name.",
      "His chambers were sparse—deliberately so. No ornate furniture, no valuable artwork, nothing that could be used against him. Just a bed, a desk, a wardrobe of practical clothing, and walls lined with locked cabinets containing the secrets of the kingdom.",
      "The dossier in his hands contained everything. Twelve years of surveillance, photographs, movement patterns, known associates. Captain Sera’s regular reports, tracking the exile’s mundane existence. Maps of Greyport with Cassian’s regular routes marked in red. Transcripts of conversations his agents had managed to overhear. A psychological profile written by a Shadow Guard analyst, attempting to understand the enigma of a prince who’d chosen to become invisible.",
      "Lucian had known where Cassian was for a decade. He’d never told anyone.",
      "Why? he asked himself, as he’d asked himself a hundred times before. Why protect him?",
      "The answer was complicated.",
      "Lucian had been sixteen when Cassian fled—old enough to understand what had happened. The seven farmers, kneeling in the mud. The King’s order, cold and absolute. The sword falling, seven times, and then the prince who’d been crying as he killed them, dropping the blade and walking away from everything he’d ever known.",
      "Sixteen was old enough to understand the politics, the pressure, the impossible position Cassian had been placed in. Old enough to recognize that their father had used his son as a weapon and then discarded him when the weapon broke.",
      "But sixteen was also young enough to still believe in heroes.",
      "Cassian had been his hero.",
      "The older brother who felt everything too deeply, who fought with desperate fury instead of practiced technique, who refused to become the cold machine their father demanded. When Lucian was small, Cassian had taught him to ride horses. Had carried him on his shoulders through the palace gardens. Had defended him against Vincent’s teasing with the kind of fierce protectiveness that made you feel invincible.",
      "Lucian had worshipped him. Had wanted to be him.",
      "And then Cassian left. Without a word. Without a goodbye. Without even looking back at the younger brother who’d loved him more than anyone.",
      "Something in Lucian had hardened that night.",
      "If even Cassian—the passionate one, the moral one, the good one—could abandon his family, then what was the point of loyalty? What was the point of caring about anyone? Better to be cold. Better to be ruthless. Better to win, because winning was the only thing that couldn’t betray you.",
      "He’d built himself into what he was now, year by careful year. The spymaster. The schemer. The one everyone feared but no one trusted. He’d done it deliberately, methodically, as a kind of armor against the weakness of love. If he felt nothing, nothing could hurt him. If he trusted no one, no one could disappoint him.",
      "But he’d never stopped watching Cassian.",
      "And now he’s coming home.",
      "The King had sent the summons that morning. Lucian had made sure it reached the right messenger—Captain Sera, who was loyal to him but not blindly so. She would deliver the message honestly, observe Cassian’s reaction, report back with the detailed observations he’d trained her to make.",
      "What will you do, brother? Will you run again? Or will you finally face what you left behind?",
      "Lucian didn’t know. And for the first time in years, he found himself genuinely curious.",
      "Curiosity was dangerous. It meant he cared about the answer.",
      "He closed the dossier. Walked to his window. The city spread out below him, glittering with lights, a tapestry of streets and buildings that held forty million souls. None of them knew what was coming. None of them understood that their kingdom had entered the most dangerous period in a generation.",
      "Aldric was dead. Someone had killed him—Lucian was almost certain, though he didn’t yet have proof. The foreign prince who’d issued the challenge had vanished too perfectly, with too much assistance. The blade had broken too conveniently. The evidence had been destroyed too quickly.",
      "The question was who, and why, and whether exposing them would serve his purposes.",
      "Maybe I’ll let Cassian investigate, he thought. Let him dig, let him find answers, let him stir up trouble. If the conspiracy becomes public, it will weaken the current power structure. And weakness creates opportunity.",
      "Opportunity for what? For himself? For the kingdom? For some vague notion of justice that he’d stopped believing in years ago?",
      "Lucian smiled slightly, watching his reflection in the dark glass of the window. It wasn’t a warm expression.",
      "Welcome home, brother, he thought. I hope you’re ready for war.",
      "Because war was coming. One way or another. The only question was who would be standing when the smoke cleared.",
      "Lucian intended to be the one left standing.",
      "He always was."

      "The rain had stopped, but the streets still glistened. Puddles reflected streetlights like captured flames.",
      "His building rose before him—five stories of declining brick. The laundromat on the ground floor hummed with perpetual activity. He’d grown to associate that smell with home—detergent and ordinary lives.",
      "Three rooms above a laundromat. It wasn’t much. It was his.",
      "He climbed the stairs slowly, adrenaline fully crashed. Forty-three. Too old to be fighting seven soldiers in the rain.",
      "His apartment was exactly as he’d left it. He stood in the threshold, taking in the space he’d called home for six years. Kitchenette, threadbare couch, narrow bed. Everything clean, everything in its place. The apartment of a man who could leave at a moment’s notice.",
      "And now you have to.",
      "The royal envelope sat on the kitchen counter. Sera must have left it while he was talking to Matthias. The last hour was a blur of violence and revelation.",
      "The Stormborn crest gleamed in crimson wax. He’d had it branded into his shoulder when he was six, screaming while his father watched without expression.",
      "The mark reminds you who you are, the King had said. What you must become.",
      "He cracked the seal. His father’s handwriting—cramped, severe, each letter formed like a battle.",
      "Cassian,",
      "Crown Prince Aldric has fallen. You are commanded to return immediately. This is not a request.",
      "The King",
      "No greeting. No acknowledgment of twelve years. Just orders.",
      "Cassian crushed the letter in his fist. The summons wouldn’t change. The King would still be waiting.",
      "A knock at the door.",
      "Cassian tensed, his body snapping back into combat readiness despite his exhaustion. He reached for the knife he kept in the kitchen drawer—a simple utility blade, nothing fancy, but sharp enough to kill if necessary. Old habits, ingrained by years of training and violence, never quite forgotten no matter how hard he tried.",
      "You’re not that man anymore.",
      "He forced himself to release the knife. Forced himself to take a breath.",
      "“It’s Captain Sera. May I come in?”",
      "He considered refusing. The smart play was to send her away, close the door, process everything that had happened in privacy. But she’d followed him home, which meant she wasn’t done talking. She’d looked at him in Father Matthias’s office with something more than professional interest—grief, perhaps, or a different kind of loss. And Cassian had questions of his own. Questions about Aldric. Questions about the blade that shouldn’t have broken, and the foreign prince who’d vanished too conveniently.",
      "He opened the door.",
      "Sera stood in the hallway, royal uniform out of place against water-stained wallpaper. She’d removed her formal jacket. Underneath, she looked less like an officer and more like a person.",
      "“I don’t remember inviting you,” Cassian said.",
      "“You didn’t. But I thought we should finish our conversation without witnesses.” She glanced past him. “May I?”",
      "He stepped aside. She entered, eyes sweeping the space—cataloging exits, sightlines, threats. More than a messenger. Whatever she was, Cassian would need to be careful.",
      "“How did Aldric really die?” He closed the door behind her.",
      "“I told you. Combat trial. His blade—”",
      "“You told me the official story.” Cassian crossed his arms. “Now tell me the truth.”",
      "“What makes you think there’s a difference?”",
      "“Because you followed me home. Either you’re under orders to watch me, or you have information you couldn’t share in front of witnesses.” He held her gaze. “Which is it?”",
      "Slowly, she sat on the threadbare couch. The professional mask slipped, revealing something raw underneath.",
      "“Both.”",
      "Cassian waited.",
      "“I’m under orders from Prince Lucian to observe you and report back. Note everything—expressions, words, hesitations.”",
      "“Lucian.” Cassian’s jaw tightened. The spymaster. The brother who’d been sixteen when he left. “He’s been watching me.”",
      "“For years. The Shadow Guard has maintained a file on you since Greyport. I’ve been filing monthly reports.”",
      "Of course. Lucian had always been thorough.",
      "“But you’re also here for another reason.”",
      "Pain flickered across her expression. “I knew Aldric. Personally.”",
      "“You loved him.”",
      "Her composure cracked. “Three years. In secret—a common-born officer wasn’t suitable for the Crown Prince. But he was going to change the succession laws. He was going to make me—”",
      "She stopped.",
      "“His queen.”",
      "Cassian moved to the window, looking out at the rain-slick street below. The cars passed in the night, their headlights cutting through the mist, ordinary people living ordinary lives. A world away from thrones and succession and murder in the arena.",
      "“Tell me what you know.”",
      "“Aldric was worried in the weeks before his death. Distracted. Nightmares. Something was weighing on him.” Sera’s voice dropped. “He said he’d made a mistake—something about his reform plans going too far. He was going to confess something to the King, but he wouldn’t tell me what. Said it was dangerous for me to know.”",
      "“A target for whom?”",
      "“He wouldn’t say. But he was afraid. I’d never seen him afraid of anything.”",
      "Cassian turned from the window. “And then the foreign prince issued his challenge.”",
      "“Prince Reynard of Carinthia. Minor kingdom, ancient territorial claims—the kind dusted off to provoke a conflict. Aldric could have sent a champion. But he never delegated anything.”",
      "“You think he was wrong?”",
      "“I think he was eager.” Sera’s voice hardened. “He went into that arena like a man who wasn’t sure he wanted to come out.”",
      "Had Aldric been carrying guilt? A burden heavy enough to make death seem preferable?",
      "“His blade broke,” Cassian said.",
      "“Shattered. Like glass.” Sera moved to the window. “Blades chip. They bend. They don’t shatter. Not royal steel. Not Garret Ironhand’s work.”",
      "“Someone sabotaged the sword.”",
      "“Yes. Someone with access, knowledge, and opportunity.” Her eyes burned. “Someone murdered Aldric. And they got away with it because the King ordered the evidence destroyed.”",
      "“Why?”",
      "“Because investigating would mean admitting conspiracy. Questioning the palace’s security. The guards’ loyalty.” She laughed bitterly. “Easier to burn the sword and call it tragedy.”",
      "“And you want me to find the truth.”",
      "“I can’t. I’m watched too closely. But you’re the exile. The failure. Everyone will underestimate you.”",
      "“You’re wrong about that.” Cassian’s voice was quiet. “I have plenty of stakes. Just not the kind you’re thinking of.”",
      "“I know.” She met his eyes. “The seven farmers. The weight you carry. The guilt that drove you here.” Her expression softened slightly. “You’re not doing this for power or position. You’re doing it because your conscience won’t let you look away from murder. That’s why you’re the only one who might actually find the truth.”",
      "They stood in silence for a moment, two strangers bound by grief and conspiracy, the weight of dead men pressing down on them both.",
      "“You’re asking me to trust you,” Cassian said finally. “To believe that you’re not just another player in the game. That your grief is real and your intentions are honest.”",
      "“Yes.”",
      "“And what do you offer in exchange for that trust?”",
      "“Information. Evidence I’ve collected independently—things Lucian doesn’t know I have. Documents, testimony, patterns that don’t add up.” Sera’s voice was steady. “And access. I can get you into places you couldn’t reach on your own, introduce you to people who would never speak to an exile prince.”",
      "“And if I find evidence that points to someone you don’t expect? Someone you care about?”",
      "“Then I’ll help you prove it anyway.” She didn’t hesitate. “I loved Aldric. I’ll tear down the kingdom if that’s what it takes to avenge him.”",
      "Cassian believed her. That was the dangerous part—he believed every word, believed the grief in her eyes and the fury in her voice. But belief wasn’t the same as trust, and trust wasn’t the same as wisdom.",
      "He sank into the chair across from the couch, the worn fabric familiar against his back. The same chair he sat in every night, eating dinner alone, watching the news, pretending he was normal. Pretending he was free.",
      "“Aldric and I weren’t close,” he said slowly. “Not by the end. He was the perfect one—the golden heir, the warrior without flaw. I was the passionate one, the one who felt too much, the one who broke when he should have bent.” He stared at his hands. “He thought I was weak for running. Said so, in the last letter he ever sent me.”",
      "“When was that?”",
      "“Eight years ago. I didn’t respond.” The memory surfaced unbidden—the letter arriving, hand-delivered by a merchant who’d asked no questions, sealed with a personal mark Cassian had recognized immediately. He’d read it three times before throwing it in the fire. The words still burned in his memory. You are a coward and a disgrace. Father was right about you. “But he was my brother. If someone murdered him, if they got away with it because the King refused to investigate…”",
      "“Then justice hasn’t been served.”",
      "“Justice.” The word tasted bitter, like copper on his tongue. Like blood. “I’m not sure I believe in that anymore. I’ve seen too many innocent people die while guilty ones prosper. The seven farmers I killed were innocent. They died, and I’m still here. That’s not justice. That’s random cruelty dressed up in ceremony.”",
      "“Then what do you believe in?”",
      "Cassian thought of the seven farmers. The way they’d looked at him before he killed them—the hope in their eyes, the desperate faith that somehow the prince would save them, would see the truth, would stop the sword from falling. He’d seen that look in Mrs. Chen’s eyes tonight, after the soldiers fell. Fear mixed with awe. The terrifying realization that the quiet mechanic was something else entirely.",
      "He thought of Father Matthias, offering absolution he didn’t deserve. Of Mrs. Chen, giving him dumplings and friendship without asking anything in return. Of the church community that had accepted him as Thomas Thorne, never knowing they’d welcomed a killer into their midst.",
      "He thought of the scars on his body and the ones that didn’t show.",
      "“I believe in debts,” he said finally. “I owe my family nothing. But I owe Aldric the truth of how he died. If someone killed him, I owe it to him to find out who.”",
      "“And then what?”",
      "“Then I decide what to do about it.”",
      "Sera nodded slowly, accepting his answer even if she didn’t fully understand it. “I can give you what I have. Evidence, contacts, intelligence. But in return, I need you to promise that whatever you find, you’ll see it through. Even if it points somewhere you don’t expect.”",
      "“You think it might point to one of my brothers.”",
      "“I think it might point anywhere.” She leaned forward, intensity burning in her eyes. “The palace is full of people who wanted Aldric dead—reformers who thought he wasn’t going far enough, traditionalists who thought he was destroying everything sacred, foreign powers who benefited from Valdrath’s instability. Lord Evander, who funded Aldric’s reforms and would be ruined if they failed. General Vance, who opposed the military reorganization. Chancellor Morin, who disagreed about the timeline.” She paused. “And yes, it might point to one of your brothers. Several of them had means, motive, and opportunity.”",
      "Cassian thought of Vincent, with his rage and his army. The brother who’d wanted to challenge him twelve years ago, who’d been held back by Aldric’s intervention. Vincent had loved Aldric—but love could curdle into something darker when it was disappointed enough times.",
      "Of Edric, with his politics and his ambition. The third prince, the one who understood how power really worked, who’d been positioning himself for years. Edric had disagreed with Aldric’s reforms, had worked to slow them down. Would he kill to stop them entirely?",
      "Of Lucian, with his spies and his secrets. The sixth prince, who’d been watching Cassian for a decade, who saw everything and understood everything and trusted no one. Lucian was the most dangerous of them all, because Lucian was the hardest to read.",
      "Even Marcus, the quiet scholar. He’d been arguing with Aldric about the reforms, about tradition, about the future of the kingdom. Marcus wasn’t a warrior—but you didn’t need a sword to arrange a murder.",
      "Everyone is a suspect. Including me, if we’re honest about who benefits from chaos.",
      "“I’ll go back,” Cassian said. “I’ll investigate. But I need you to understand something.”",
      "“What’s that?”",
      "“I’m not doing this for the kingdom. I’m not doing this for the throne, or for whatever faction you might represent, or for the grand cause of justice in the abstract.” He stood, moving to the door, ready to end this conversation before it extracted promises he couldn’t keep. “I’m doing it because I failed my family once, and maybe this is a chance to fail them less. Because Aldric was my brother, whatever else he was, and his death deserves an answer. Because—”",
      "He stopped. The words caught in his throat.",
      "“Because someone should care about the truth,” Sera finished softly. “Even when no one else does.”",
      "“Something like that.” He opened the door. “After I find the truth, I’m coming back here. Back to my life, or what’s left of it. I don’t want to be a prince. I don’t want to be anything but what I am.”",
      "Sera studied him for a long moment, her eyes searching his face for something he couldn’t name. Then she rose from the couch and moved toward the door.",
      "“You might not have a choice. Once you’re back in the palace, you’ll be part of the game whether you want to be or not. Everyone will be watching you—the exile prince returned, the failure come home. Everyone will be trying to use you.”",
      "“Let them try.”",
      "“You sound confident.”",
      "“I sound tired.” He stepped aside to let her pass. “Two days to settle my affairs. Then we leave.”",
      "Sera paused in the doorway, close enough that he could see the exhaustion behind her professional mask, the grief she was trying so hard to hide. “For what it’s worth, I think Aldric was wrong about you. He called you weak, but walking away from power takes more strength than claiming it. You might be the strongest of all the King’s sons.”",
      "“Strength didn’t save Aldric. Didn’t save my mother. Didn’t save the seven farmers I killed on the King’s orders.” Cassian’s voice was hollow. “Strength is overrated.”",
      "“Maybe. But it’s all we have.”",
      "She left, her footsteps receding down the hallway, the sound of the stairwell door opening and closing behind her. Cassian stood in the doorway for a long moment, watching the empty corridor, the flickering fluorescent lights, the water stains on the wallpaper that looked like maps of countries he’d never visit.",
      "Then he closed the door and stood alone in his apartment, surrounded by the life he’d built and the life he was about to tear apart.",
      "He didn’t sleep that night.",
      "The hours passed in a blur of restless movement, his mind racing even as his body demanded rest. He tried lying down, but the bed felt too small, too confining. He tried sitting in his chair, but the silence pressed against him like a weight. He tried reading—the worn copy of the Warrior’s Litany that he’d never quite been able to throw away—but the words blurred on the page, meaningless syllables that offered no comfort.",
      "Instead, he packed.",
      "It didn’t take long. Twelve years of existence fit into a single bag—clothes, toiletries, a worn bible from the Church of the Eternal Blade, a photograph of his mother that he’d carried since he fled. The photograph was creased, faded, edges soft from years of handling. Marianne Stormborn smiled out from it, frozen in a moment when she’d still been alive, still been the heart of a family that had since shattered into broken pieces.",
      "Cassian had been eighteen when the picture was taken, standing beside her in the palace gardens, young and unburdened. His arm was around her shoulders, and she was laughing at something one of them had said—he couldn’t remember what anymore. The details had faded with time, worn away by years of grief and guilt until only the image remained.",
      "He touched her face. Paper under his fingers. Memory under his skin.",
      "Take care of them. All of them.",
      "“I’m trying,” he whispered to the empty apartment, to the photograph, to whatever remained of his mother’s spirit. “I’m still trying.”",
      "Dawn came grey and reluctant, seeping through his window like diluted light. The city woke around him—cars starting, doors slamming, the distant rumble of the industrial district coming to life. Ordinary sounds. Ordinary life. Everything he was leaving behind.",
      "He walked to the shop.",
      "Thorne & Merrick Automotive occupied a converted warehouse on the industrial side of Greyport, three blocks from the docks and five from the railway yard. The building had been a storage facility once, before Merrick had bought it twenty years ago and turned it into the best repair shop in the district. Iron doors, grease-stained concrete, the smell of motor oil and ambition and honest work.",
      "Cassian had found his way here six years ago, after the previous mechanic had died of a heart attack and Merrick had needed someone who could handle the complicated jobs. He’d applied with false papers and a fake history, and Merrick had hired him without asking questions. They’d worked side by side ever since, sharing tools and silence and the unspoken understanding of men who’d both run from something.",
      "Merrick was already there, as he always was, buried under the hood of a vintage sedan that had been giving them trouble for weeks. The car was a 1972 Imperial—a collector’s piece in better condition, but this one had been neglected for years, its engine a mess of corrosion and makeshift repairs. Merrick had taken it on as a personal project, refusing to give up on it even when simpler cars needed attention.",
      "He was a big man, mid-fifties, with arms like tree trunks and a face that had been broken so many times it had stopped healing properly. Former boxer, Cassian guessed, or maybe military. They’d never discussed it. Some pasts were better left undisturbed.",
      "“You’re early,” Merrick said without looking up, his voice muffled by the engine compartment.",
      "“I’m leaving.”",
      "That got his attention. The big man straightened, wiping his hands on a rag that was already more grease than cloth. His eyes—sharp despite their tired appearance—fixed on Cassian with sudden intensity.",
      "“How long?”",
      "“I don’t know.”",
      "Merrick studied him for a long moment. They’d never talked about Cassian’s past—Merrick wasn’t the type to pry, and Cassian wasn’t the type to offer. But there had always been an understanding between them. They were both men running from something, trying to build something new from the wreckage of who they’d been.",
      "“You in trouble?”",
      "“The opposite.” Cassian managed a smile that felt wrong on his face. “I’m about to walk into it.”",
      "Merrick nodded slowly, absorbing this. “Anything to do with those soldiers last night?”",
      "“You heard about that?”",
      "“Whole neighborhood heard about that. Seven men, beaten to pulp in a church parking lot. Police are calling it gang violence.” Merrick’s eyes were sharp. “We both know better.”",
      "Cassian didn’t respond.",
      "“Known you six years,” Merrick said, tossing the rag aside and leaning against the Imperial’s fender. “You’re the best mechanic I’ve ever met and the worst liar. Whatever you’re running from, it’s gonna kill you eventually. Maybe facing it kills you faster.” He shrugged, a philosophical gesture. “But at least it’s honest.”",
      "“That’s what everyone keeps telling me.”",
      "“Smart people.” Merrick extended his hand. “Take care of yourself, Thorne. Or whatever your real name is.”",
      "Cassian shook it, feeling the calluses, the strength, the years of honest work. “Take care of the shop.”",
      "“Always do.”",
      "He walked out without looking back. If he looked back, he might not leave.",
      "The next stop was harder.",
      "Father Matthias was in the church sanctuary, sweeping the floor between the pews with the slow, careful movements of age. He favored his left leg—arthritis that got worse every winter, he’d said once, though Cassian suspected there were old injuries beneath the surface as well. The marks of a life before the priesthood. When he saw Cassian, he set the broom aside and gestured to the altar.",
      "They sat together in the front pew, facing the forge-brazier that burned eternally at the heart of the Church of the Eternal Blade. The flames were low this morning, barely more than embers, casting a warm glow across the ancient stones.",
      "“Mrs. Chen is fine,” Matthias said before Cassian could ask. “Shaken, but unharmed. She asked me to thank you.”",
      "“She should have called the police.”",
      "“She did. They didn’t come. Royal soldiers enjoy certain… immunities.” The old priest’s voice was dry. “You already know this.”",
      "Cassian stared at the embers. “I’m going back.”",
      "“I know.”",
      "“I might not come home.”",
      "“I know that, too.”",
      "Silence fell between them, filled only by the soft crackle of the flames. Cassian had sat in this pew hundreds of times—thousands, maybe—but never like this. Never knowing it might be the last time.",
      "“I’ve been coming here for twelve years,” he said slowly. “Every Sunday. Sitting in the back pew. Praying for forgiveness I don’t deserve.” He turned to face Matthias. “You knew who I was the whole time. Why didn’t you say anything?”",
      "“Because you needed to be someone else for a while.” Matthias’s voice was gentle, the voice of a man who’d heard countless confessions and learned not to judge. “Everyone does, eventually. The question isn’t whether we hide—it’s whether we’re hiding from ourselves or toward something better.”",
      "“And which was I doing?”",
      "“Both. At different times.” Matthias’s remaining hand rested on Cassian’s shoulder, warm and steady. “You’re a good man, Cassian Stormborn. You were a good man when you arrived, broken and bleeding from wounds no one could see. You’re a good man now, scarred but still trying.”",
      "“I killed seven people. On my father’s orders. I killed them and ran away rather than face what I’d done.”",
      "“And in twelve years, have you stopped feeling guilty? Have you stopped trying to atone?”",
      "Cassian’s throat tightened. The words wouldn’t come.",
      "“Then you understand something most people never learn.” Matthias squeezed his shoulder. “Guilt is not weakness. It’s proof that your conscience still lives. Go back. Face your family. Find the truth about your brother. And when you’re done, come home.”",
      "“What if I don’t survive?”",
      "“Then I’ll light a candle for you every Sunday and tell the congregation about the mechanic who saved an old woman in a parking lot.” Matthias smiled slightly. “They’ll like that story.”",
      "Cassian found himself smiling back, despite everything. “You’re a strange priest.”",
      "“The best ones are.”",
      "They sat together a moment longer, watching the embers burn. Then Cassian rose, pressed his hand to the altar in blessing, and walked toward the door.",
      "“Cassian.”",
      "He paused.",
      "“Your mother’s last words—take care of them, all of them.” Matthias’s voice was soft. “I think she meant more than your brothers.”",
      "“What else is there?”",
      "“The kingdom. The people. Everyone who suffers under the weight of traditions that have lost their meaning.” The old priest’s eyes were steady. “You’re not just going back to find a killer. You’re going back to finish something you started when you left. The question is whether you’ll have the courage to see it through.”",
      "Cassian thought about that. About the seven farmers, and the warrior’s code that had condemned them, and the system that made their deaths legal. About Aldric, who’d wanted to reform that system but hadn’t survived to complete the work. About his father, who saw strength as the only virtue and weakness as the only sin.",
      "“I don’t know if I’m strong enough,” he admitted.",
      "“Neither do I,” Matthias said. “But I believe the Divine Smith forges us for a purpose. Maybe this is yours.”",
      "Cassian left the church without answering.",
      "But he carried the question with him, all through that long day, as he wrote letters to Mrs. Chen and Merrick and the few others who’d become something like friends. As he packed the last of his belongings. As he stood in his empty apartment at midnight, waiting for dawn.",
      "What’s my purpose?",
      "He was about to find out."
