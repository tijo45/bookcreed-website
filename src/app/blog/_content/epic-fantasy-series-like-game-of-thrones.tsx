        You finished <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> — or at least as much as
        George R.R. Martin has written — and now there&apos;s a void. You
        want the sprawling politics, the morally grey characters who betray
        each other over dinner, the sense that any character could die at any
        moment. You want fantasy that treats power as something dangerous and
        fascinating, not a reward for being the chosen one.
      </p>
      <p>
        Good news: the genre has delivered. Here are five epic fantasy series
        that capture what makes <em>Game of Thrones</em> so addictive — and
        each brings something Martin&apos;s series doesn&apos;t.
      </p>

      <h2>1. The First Law Trilogy by Joe Abercrombie</h2>
      <p>
        If you think Tyrion Lannister is cynical, wait until you meet Sand dan
        Glokta — a torturer who was once tortured himself, dragging his broken
        body through palace corridors while dismantling conspiracies with a
        smile. <em>The Blade Itself</em> kicks off a trilogy that takes every
        heroic fantasy trope and guts it like a fish.
      </p>
      <p>
        Abercrombie writes dialogue that crackles with dark humor, and his
        battle scenes are visceral without being gratuitous. The world feels
        lived-in and cynical in the same way Westeros does — every noble
        house has an agenda, every alliance has an expiration date. But where
        Martin sometimes sprawls, Abercrombie keeps things razor-tight. The
        original trilogy is complete, and the follow-up <em>Age of Madness</em>{" "}
        trilogy adds an industrial revolution twist that makes the political
        dynamics even more compelling.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Start with:</strong> <em>The Blade Itself</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Best for:</strong> Readers who love Tyrion&apos;s chapters and
        wish the whole series had that energy.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Realm of the Elderlings by Robin Hobb</h2>
      <p>
        Robin Hobb&apos;s masterwork begins with{" "}
        <em>Assassin&apos;s Apprentice</em>, and from the first chapter you
        understand something important: this is fantasy that cares about the
        emotional cost of power. FitzChivalry Farseer is a royal bastard
        trained as an assassin — a premise that sounds like a dozen other
        books until Hobb makes you feel every knife-twist of loneliness, duty,
        and sacrifice that comes with it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The series spans sixteen books across multiple trilogies, each exploring
        different corners of a richly drawn world. The political intrigue is
        quieter than Martin&apos;s — more whispered conversations in cold
        hallways than Red Wedding spectacles — but it cuts deeper because
        Hobb makes you love these characters so completely that their betrayals
        feel personal. If you cried during Ned Stark&apos;s death, Robin Hobb
        will destroy you in ways you didn&apos;t know were possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Start with:</strong> <em>Assassin&apos;s Apprentice</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Best for:</strong> Readers who want the political complexity of
        GoT with the deepest character writing in the genre.
      </p>

      <h2>3. The Poppy War by R.F. Kuang</h2>
      <p>
        Rin is a war orphan who tests into the most elite military academy in
        the Nikara Empire — and that&apos;s just the first act.{" "}
        <em>The Poppy War</em> starts as a dark academia fantasy and then
        swerves into a brutal war epic inspired by the Second Sino-Japanese War
        and the Rape of Nanjing. It&apos;s the kind of fantasy that makes you
        deeply uncomfortable, and that&apos;s exactly the point.
      </p>
      <p>
        Like <em>Game of Thrones</em>, this trilogy refuses to look away from
        the human cost of war and power. Rin makes increasingly terrible
        decisions, each one understandable in context, each one pushing her
        further from the person she wanted to be. The political machinations
        between the Empire&apos;s factions are complex and ruthless, and
        Kuang&apos;s willingness to let her protagonist become a monster gives
        the series a moral weight that lingers long after you finish.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Start with:</strong> <em>The Poppy War</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Best for:</strong> Readers who appreciate Game of Thrones&apos;
        unflinching take on war and want a non-European fantasy setting.

          The Kingdom of Valdrath
        </Link>{" "}
        by Eva Noir
      </h2>
      <p>
        Seven brothers. A dying king. A murdered heir. And a kingdom that&apos;s
        been cracking at the seams for generations.{" "}

          <em>The Exile&apos;s Return</em>
        </Link>{" "}
        opens with Prince Kael returning from years of exile to find his family
        tearing the kingdom apart from the inside. If you love the Lannister
        family dynamics — the toxic loyalty, the power grabs masked as duty,
        the sibling rivalries that reshape nations — Valdrath delivers that
        energy across an eight-book saga.
      </p>
      <p>
        What sets this series apart is the depth of its{" "}
        <Link href="/lore/world" className="text-gold-400 hover:underline">
          world-building
        </Link>
        . Author Eva Noir built an entire cultural database — religions,
        economic systems, social hierarchies — before writing a single chapter.
        The result is a world that feels as layered as Westeros, where political
        decisions have consequences that ripple across books. The &ldquo;Seven
        Scars&rdquo; — seven cataclysmic events that shaped the continent —
        give the history real weight and make the current power struggles feel
        like the latest chapter in a much longer story.

      <h2>5. The Traitor Baru Cormorant by Seth Dickinson</h2>
      <p>
        Imagine if Littlefinger were the protagonist. Now imagine you had to
        watch every sacrifice, every manipulation, every betrayal from inside
        his head — and somehow still root for him. That&apos;s Baru Cormorant,
        an accountant from a colonized island who infiltrates the empire that
        conquered her homeland with the goal of destroying it from within.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The Traitor Baru Cormorant</em> is political fantasy at its most
        intellectually rigorous. Dickinson understands economics, colonial
        governance, and the machinery of empire in ways that make the political
        intrigue feel genuinely sophisticated rather than hand-wavy. Every
        chapter forces Baru to choose between her mission and the people she
        loves, and the book&apos;s final twist is one of the most devastating
        in modern fantasy. The four-book <em>Masquerade</em> series is
        complete, so you can experience the full arc without waiting.

      <h2>What Makes These Series &ldquo;Like Game of Thrones&rdquo;?</h2>
      <p>
        It&apos;s not just the violence or the medieval settings — plenty of
        fantasy books have those. What made <em>Game of Thrones</em> special
        was the feeling that the rules of storytelling didn&apos;t apply.
        Characters you loved could die. Villains could win. The &ldquo;right
        thing&rdquo; could get you killed. Every series on this list captures
        that unpredictability while adding its own twist:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Abercrombie</strong> adds sharp humor and asks whether heroism
          is even possible.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Hobb</strong> makes the political personal and the personal
          devastating.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Kuang</strong> expands the lens beyond medieval Europe and
          confronts real historical atrocities.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Noir</strong> builds a dynasty saga where family is both
          weapon and weakness.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Dickinson</strong> weaponizes economics and colonial policy as
          tools of intrigue.
        </li>
      </ul>
