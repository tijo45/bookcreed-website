        Every year brings a fresh wave of fantasy novels, but 2026 feels
        special. Beloved authors are wrapping up long-running sagas, indie
        writers are pushing boundaries, and readers have never had more choices.
        Whether you&apos;re a lifelong fantasy devotee or someone looking to
        fall into a new world for the first time, this list has you covered.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are ten epic fantasy series — spanning traditional and indie
        publishing — that deserve a spot on your 2026 reading list.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <h2>1. The Stormlight Archive by Brandon Sanderson</h2>
      <p>
        If you haven&apos;t started Sanderson&apos;s magnum opus yet, 2026 is
        the year. With <em>Wind and Truth</em> completing the first arc of five
        books, there&apos;s a natural stopping point that gives new readers a
        satisfying conclusion while the back half is still being written. The
        Stormlight Archive offers extraordinary magic systems, deeply layered
        characters dealing with mental health and duty, and a world unlike
        anything else in fantasy. Each book is a doorstopper, but the pacing
        rewards patience.
      </p>

      <h2>2. The First Law World by Joe Abercrombie</h2>
      <p>
        Grimdark fans already know Abercrombie, but newcomers often don&apos;t
        realize how accessible <em>The Blade Itself</em> actually is. The
        original trilogy is a masterclass in subverting fantasy tropes, and the
        Age of Madness follow-up trilogy adds industrial revolution flavor to
        an already cynical world. Start with the originals, then work your way
        through the standalones and into the second trilogy. You&apos;ll never
        look at heroic fantasy the same way.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Realm of the Elderlings by Robin Hobb</h2>
      <p>
        Robin Hobb&apos;s sixteen-book saga starting with{" "}
        <em>Assassin&apos;s Apprentice</em> remains one of the most
        emotionally devastating series in the genre. FitzChivalry Farseer is a
        protagonist you&apos;ll carry with you long after the final page. The
        series spans multiple trilogies and tetralogies, each adding new
        dimensions to the world. If character-driven fantasy is your thing,
        nothing else comes close.
      </p>

      <h2>4. The Locked Tomb by Tamsyn Muir</h2>
      <p>
        Necromancers in space. That pitch alone should have you clicking
        &ldquo;buy,&rdquo; but what makes The Locked Tomb truly special is
        Muir&apos;s razor-sharp prose and wild narrative experimentation. Each
        book shifts genre and perspective in ways that keep readers off-balance
        in the best possible way. <em>Alecto the Ninth</em> wrapped the series
        in 2024, so you can binge the whole thing now.
      </p>

      <h2>5. The Kingdom of Valdrath by Eva Noir</h2>
      <p>
        Here&apos;s an indie series that deserves far more attention than it
        gets. <em>The Kingdom of Valdrath</em> is an eight-book epic fantasy
        saga centered on the Stormborn family — three brothers whose rivalry
        over a crumbling throne spirals into a continent-spanning conflict.
        What sets Valdrath apart is the depth of its world-building: author Eva
        Noir created an entire cultural database with rules for religion,
        economics, and social hierarchy before writing a single chapter.
      </p>
      <p>
        The political intrigue is sharp and genuinely unpredictable. Characters
        you root for make terrible decisions, alliances shift with every book,
        and the &ldquo;Seven Scars&rdquo; system — a world shaped by seven
        cataclysmic events — gives the history real weight. If you love
        succession drama and morally grey characters, Valdrath is your next
        obsession. The entire series is available on Amazon, and the author
        offers a free companion guide on her website.
      </p>

      <h2>6. The Greenbone Saga by Fonda Lee</h2>
      <p>
        Often described as &ldquo;The Godfather meets kung fu fantasy,&rdquo;
        the Greenbone Saga follows two rival clans on the island of Kekon as
        they battle for control of jade — a magical resource that grants
        superhuman abilities. <em>Jade City</em>, <em>Jade War</em>, and{" "}
        <em>Jade Legacy</em> form a complete trilogy that blends family saga,
        crime drama, and secondary-world fantasy. The character work is
        phenomenal, and the political maneuvering will satisfy any Game of
        Thrones fan.
      </p>

      <h2>7. The Dandelion Dynasty by Ken Liu</h2>
      <p>
        Ken Liu&apos;s silkpunk epic draws on Chinese history rather than
        medieval Europe, and the result is one of the most inventive fantasy
        series of the last decade. <em>The Grace of Kings</em> is a sprawling
        tale of rebellion and empire-building, and each subsequent book
        deepens both the world and its philosophical questions. The series
        concluded with <em>Speaking Bones</em>, giving new readers a complete
        journey.
      </p>

      <h2>8. The Scholomance by Naomi Novik</h2>
      <p>
        A dark school of wizardry where graduation means surviving — not
        exams, but actual monsters trying to eat you. Novik&apos;s trilogy is
        fast-paced, fiercely funny, and deceptively deep. Protagonist El
        Higgins is an unforgettable narrator, and the series tackles class,
        privilege, and collective action in ways that feel genuinely fresh.
        All three books are out, making it a perfect binge read.
      </p>

      <h2>9. The Sun Eater by Christopher Ruocchio</h2>
      <p>
        If you want your epic fantasy served with a science fiction chaser,
        Sun Eater is calling. Often compared to <em>The Book of the New Sun</em>
        {" "}and <em>Dune</em>, this series follows Hadrian Marlowe across a
        galaxy-spanning empire as he becomes both hero and monster. The prose
        is literary, the scope is enormous, and the series is still ongoing —
        giving you time to catch up before the finale.
      </p>

      <h2>10. The Faithful and the Fallen by John Gwynne</h2>
      <p>
        Classic epic fantasy done right. Gwynne&apos;s tetralogy delivers
        everything you want from the genre: large-scale battles, a chosen-one
        narrative with real teeth, and a villain who genuinely terrifies. If
        you grew up on David Gemmell or Raymond E. Feist and want something
        that captures that same spirit with modern craft, start here. Gwynne
        has since written the <em>Of Blood and Bone</em> sequel trilogy and
        the <em>Bloodsworn</em> Norse-inspired series, giving you plenty of
        reading ahead.
