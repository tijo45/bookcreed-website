        We&apos;ve been conditioned to expect the hero&apos;s triumph. The
        chosen one rallies, the dark lord falls, the kingdom is saved. But
        some of the best fantasy books in the genre flip that script
        entirely — the villain wins, the hero fails, and the story is
        better for it. These are the books where darkness doesn&apos;t
        just threaten the world. It <em>takes</em> it.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you&apos;re tired of predictable endings and want fantasy books
        where the villain wins — or at least comes terrifyingly close —
        this list is for you. Fair warning: we&apos;ll keep spoilers
        vague, but the premise of this list is inherently spoiler-adjacent.
        Proceed with delicious caution.

      <h2>1. The First Law Trilogy by Joe Abercrombie</h2>
      <p>
        Abercrombie didn&apos;t just write a fantasy trilogy where the
        villain wins — he wrote one where you don&apos;t even realize
        who the villain <em>is</em> until it&apos;s too late. The First
        Law builds toward what feels like a traditional fantasy climax:
        armies clashing, ancient evil rising, heroes making their stand.
        Then it pulls the rug out so hard you question every assumption
        you made across three books. The puppet master was always in
        control. The heroes were always pawns. And the world ends up
        worse than where it started — which, in Abercrombie&apos;s
        universe, is saying something.
      </p>

      <h2>2. The Kingdom of Valdrath by Eva Noir</h2>
      <p>
        Eva Noir&apos;s eight-book series does something rare: it lets
        the villain&apos;s arc play out with the same narrative weight
        and emotional investment as the hero&apos;s. Lucian — the
        younger prince of Valdrath — doesn&apos;t start as a villain.
        He starts as a brother, a son, a man who believes he deserves
        the throne more than Cassian does. And the terrifying thing is,
        he might be right. As the series progresses, Lucian&apos;s
        descent isn&apos;t a sudden heel turn — it&apos;s a slow,
        methodical accumulation of choices that each make perfect sense
        in isolation but add up to something monstrous.
      </p>
      <p>
        What makes Lucian&apos;s arc devastating is that he{" "}
        <em>wins</em> — not in the cartoonish sense, but in ways that
        cost every character something irreplaceable. By the time
        Cassian understands what his brother has become, Lucian has
        already reshaped the kingdom in his image. The entire series
        is available now on{" "}

        , and Lucian&apos;s transformation across all eight books is
        one of the most compelling villain arcs in modern fantasy.
      </p>

      <h2>3. The Poppy War by R.F. Kuang</h2>
      <p>
        Kuang&apos;s trilogy doesn&apos;t have a traditional villain in
        the mustache-twirling sense — it has systems, empires, and a
        protagonist who becomes the thing she fought against. Rin starts
        as an underdog you root for unconditionally. By the end of the
        trilogy, she&apos;s committed acts that make you sick. The
        &ldquo;villain&rdquo; who wins here is war itself — the cycle of
        violence that consumes everyone who participates. Nobody escapes
        clean. Nobody wins. The empire grinds on.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Prince of Thorns by Mark Lawrence</h2>
      <p>
        Jorg Ancrath is the villain. He&apos;s also the protagonist. And
        he wins — not despite being a monster but <em>because</em> of it.
        Lawrence&apos;s Broken Empire trilogy follows a teenage prince
        who murders, manipulates, and schemes his way to an emperor&apos;s
        throne, and the series never pretends this is a redemption arc.
        Jorg gets what he wants. The cost is everyone around him. The
        brilliance is that Lawrence makes you understand — not
        sympathize, but understand — every terrible decision. You
        watch the villain win and feel something uncomfortably close
        to satisfaction.
      </p>

      <h2>5. The Realm of the Elderlings by Robin Hobb</h2>
      <p>
        Hobb&apos;s villains don&apos;t cackle from dark towers. They
        sit on councils, speak reasonably, and destroy lives through
        bureaucracy and indifference. Regal Farseer — FitzChivalry&apos;s
        uncle — wins repeatedly throughout the Farseer trilogy, and his
        victories are infuriating precisely because they&apos;re so
        <em>mundane</em>. He doesn&apos;t need dark magic. He just
        needs political power and a willingness to let good people
        suffer. Hobb understands that the scariest villains are the
        ones who win by making the system work for them.
      </p>

      <h2>6. The Second Apocalypse by R. Scott Bakker</h2>
      <p>
        Bakker&apos;s series is philosophy wrapped in apocalypse, and
        the villain — if you can even call the Consult that, given the
        cosmic horror at play — operates on a scale that makes human
        resistance feel cosmically irrelevant. The protagonist,
        Kellhus, might be the real villain, a manipulator so skilled
        that entire civilizations bend to his will while believing
        they&apos;re acting freely. By the end of <em>The Unholy
        Consult</em>, the darkness doesn&apos;t just win — it
        reveals that winning was never really in question. This is
        grimdark at its most intellectually punishing.
      </p>

      <h2>7. A Song of Ice and Fire by George R.R. Martin</h2>
      <p>
        Yes, the series is unfinished. But through five books, the
        villains win <em>constantly</em>. The Red Wedding alone is
        the most devastating villain victory in modern fantasy — a
        systematic destruction of the Stark cause that happens at a
        dinner table. Tywin Lannister wins wars without swinging a
        sword. Littlefinger reshapes kingdoms through whispers. The
        Boltons take Winterfell. Martin&apos;s genius is showing that
        in a world without plot armor, the ruthless and the calculating
        win — and the honorable die. Ned Stark taught us that lesson
        in book one. We just didn&apos;t want to believe it.
      </p>

      <h2>8. The Traitor Baru Cormorant by Seth Dickinson</h2>
      <p>
        Dickinson&apos;s novel asks: what if the villain is the
        protagonist, and she doesn&apos;t realize it yet? Baru
        Cormorant infiltrates the empire that conquered her homeland,
        rising through its financial bureaucracy with a plan to
        destroy it from within. The ending — which we won&apos;t
        spoil — redefines everything you thought you understood about
        who the villain is and what &ldquo;winning&rdquo; means. It&apos;s
        one of the most gut-wrenching final chapters in fantasy, and
        it haunts you because you realize the empire didn&apos;t just
        win the war. It won Baru.

      <h2>Why Villain Victories Make Better Fantasy</h2>
      <p>
        The appeal isn&apos;t sadism — it&apos;s stakes. When readers
        know the hero always wins, tension evaporates. But when the
        villain can win — when they <em>do</em> win — every scene
        carries genuine danger. Abercrombie&apos;s puppet master makes
        you distrust every mentor figure in fiction. Lucian&apos;s
        transformation in <em>The Kingdom of Valdrath</em> makes you
        reread earlier books looking for the cracks. Martin&apos;s Red
        Wedding made an entire generation of readers understand that
        no character is safe.
      </p>
      <p>
        The best villain victories aren&apos;t nihilistic — they&apos;re{" "}
        <em>meaningful</em>. They reveal something about power, about
        human nature, about the cost of good intentions in a world
        that doesn&apos;t reward them. If you want fantasy that trusts
        you enough to show you the dark ending, these eight books —
        and series — deliver.
