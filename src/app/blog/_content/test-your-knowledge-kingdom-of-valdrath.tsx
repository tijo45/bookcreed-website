      <h2>How the Kingdom of Valdrath Quiz Works</h2>

      <p>
        The concept is simple, but earning a top score isn&apos;t. Here&apos;s
        how it works:
      </p>

      <h3>Step 1: Read the Book</h3>
      <p>
        Every quiz is tied to a specific book in the series. Start with{" "}
        <a
          href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0GKXNCCXD"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
        >
          The Exile&apos;s Return (Book 1)
        </a>{" "}
        or{" "}
        <a
          href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0GL3YQFKS"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
        >
          The Shadow&apos;s Reach (Book 2)
        </a>
        . The questions draw from specific scenes, dialogue, character details,
        and world-building — so you&apos;ll need to have actually read the book
        to compete. Surface-level knowledge won&apos;t cut it here.
      </p>

      <h3>Step 2: Find Your Access Code</h3>
      <p>
        At the end of each book, you&apos;ll find a <strong>Quiz Challenge
        page</strong> with a unique access code. This code unlocks the quiz for
        that specific book on{" "}
        <Link href="/quiz">bookcreed.com/quiz</Link>. It&apos;s our way of
        making sure every quiz taker has actually read the story — and it keeps
        the competition fair.
      </p>

      <h3>Step 3: Take the Quiz</h3>
      <p>
        Each book quiz features <strong>100 unique questions</strong> covering
        every corner of that book&apos;s story. We&apos;re talking character
        motivations, specific plot points, world lore, dialogue callbacks, and
        details that only true readers would catch. The questions are timed, so
        you can&apos;t just look everything up — you need to <em>know</em> the
        material.
      </p>

      <h3>Step 4: Compete on the Leaderboard</h3>
      <p>
        Your score lands on the{" "}
        <Link href="/leaderboard">public leaderboard</Link>, ranked against
        every other reader who&apos;s taken the quiz. This isn&apos;t a random
        drawing or a participation trophy system. The{" "}
        <strong>highest scores win</strong>. Period. If you want to earn prizes,
        you need to outperform the competition.
      </p>

      <h3>Step 5: Win Gift Cards</h3>
      <p>
        At the end of each contest cohort, the top scorers on the leaderboard
        win gift card prizes. The better your score, the better your chances.
        Check the{" "}
        <Link href="/contest/rules">official contest rules</Link> for full
        details on prizes, eligibility, and cohort timing.

      <h2>Why a Skill-Based Fantasy Book Quiz Contest?</h2>

      <p>
        Most book giveaways are random. You enter, you cross your fingers, and
        you hope for luck. That never felt right for a series about political
        strategy, sharp minds, and earning your place in a brutal kingdom.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Kingdom of Valdrath quiz contest is <strong>skill-based</strong>.
        Your outcome is determined by how well you know the books — not by
        chance. That means the most dedicated, attentive readers are the ones who
        win. It rewards the people who pay attention to Eva Noir&apos;s layered
        world-building, who catch the subtle foreshadowing, and who remember the
        details that make this series special.
      </p>

      <p>
        It&apos;s also a way to connect with other readers. When you see your
        name on the leaderboard alongside other fantasy fans, it creates a sense
        of community — a shared challenge that goes beyond just reading alone.
        Think of it as your own personal succession crisis, except instead of
        fighting for the throne of Valdrath, you&apos;re competing for bragging
        rights and gift cards.
      </p>

      <h2>100 Questions Per Book — No Easy Ride</h2>

      <p>
        Let&apos;s be clear: these quizzes are not beginner-level. Each book
        quiz has <strong>100 carefully crafted questions</strong> that test deep
        comprehension. You&apos;ll face questions about:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Character relationships</strong> — Who betrayed whom? What
          motivates each Stormborn brother?
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Plot details</strong> — Specific events, turning points, and
          consequences that drive the story forward
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>World lore</strong> — The Seven Scars, the political factions,
          the history of Valdrath
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Dialogue and scenes</strong> — Key conversations and moments
          that reveal character
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Themes and subtext</strong> — The deeper currents running
          beneath the surface of the narrative
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        If you speed-read and skipped the &ldquo;slower&rdquo; chapters, you
        might struggle. If you savored every page, you&apos;re in a great
        position. The quiz rewards careful, engaged reading — which is exactly
        the kind of reading the Kingdom of Valdrath was written for.
      </p>
