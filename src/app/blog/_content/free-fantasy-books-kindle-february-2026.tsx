      <h2>2. The Blade Itself by Joe Abercrombie — Kindle Deal</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Genre:</strong> Grimdark Fantasy
        <br />
        <strong>Pages:</strong> 515
        <br />
        <strong>Deal:</strong> Frequently discounted to $2.99 or free during
        promotions
      </p>
      <p>
        Joe Abercrombie&apos;s debut novel is one of the most celebrated
        grimdark fantasies ever written, and Amazon regularly puts it on deep
        discount or makes it free as a gateway to the First Law universe. Three
        protagonists — a barbarian trying to escape his violent past, a crippled
        torturer who loves his job, and a vain nobleman forced into war —
        collide in a world where heroes are a myth and everyone has an angle.
        Check the Kindle store for the current price; it&apos;s frequently
        the cheapest entry point into elite fantasy.

      <h2>3. Theft of Swords by Michael J. Sullivan — Free First-in-Series</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Genre:</strong> Classic Epic Fantasy / Adventure
        <br />
        <strong>Pages:</strong> 671
        <br />
        <strong>Deal:</strong> Regularly free or $0.99 on Kindle
      </p>
      <p>
        Michael J. Sullivan&apos;s <em>Riyria Revelations</em> series is a
        love letter to classic fantasy with a modern edge. Two thieves — Royce,
        the cynical assassin, and Hadrian, the idealistic swordsman — are
        framed for the murder of a king and drawn into a conspiracy that spans
        centuries. Sullivan originally self-published this series before Orbit
        picked it up, making it a genuine indie-to-traditional success story.
        The banter between the leads is some of the best buddy-duo writing in
        the genre, and the series gets progressively more ambitious with each
        book. Check Amazon — Sullivan frequently runs the first book free
        to hook new readers.

      <h2>4. The Final Empire by Brandon Sanderson — Kindle Promotion</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Genre:</strong> Epic Fantasy / Heist
        <br />
        <strong>Pages:</strong> 541
        <br />
        <strong>Deal:</strong> Periodically free or deeply discounted on Kindle
      </p>
      <p>
        What if the Dark Lord won a thousand years ago? That&apos;s the premise
        of <em>Mistborn: The Final Empire</em>, where a crew of magical thieves
        plans to overthrow an immortal tyrant. Sanderson&apos;s Allomancy magic
        system — where characters gain powers by ingesting and &ldquo;burning
        &rdquo; metals — is one of the most creative in the genre. Tor Books
        regularly runs promotions on this one, especially during fantasy
        awareness campaigns. Even if it&apos;s not free when you read this,
        it&apos;s almost always under $3 and worth every penny as the gateway to
        Sanderson&apos;s interconnected Cosmere universe.

      <h2>5. Senlin Ascends by Josiah Bancroft — Hidden Gem</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Genre:</strong> Fantasy Adventure / New Weird
        <br />
        <strong>Pages:</strong> 390
        <br />
        <strong>Deal:</strong> Frequently free or discounted as first-in-series
        promotion
      </p>
      <p>
        A mild-mannered schoolteacher loses his wife in the Tower of Babel — a
        massive, labyrinthine structure where each level is its own bizarre
        civilization — and must transform himself to survive long enough to find
        her. <em>Senlin Ascends</em> is one of the great indie-to-traditional
        fantasy success stories, originally self-published before being picked
        up by Orbit. Josiah Bancroft&apos;s prose is gorgeous, the world is
        wildly imaginative, and the character arc of Thomas Senlin from
        pushover to cunning survivor is deeply satisfying. The complete
        four-book <em>Books of Babel</em> series is finished, so you can
        binge the whole thing.

      <h2>6. Blood Song by Anthony Ryan — Frequently Free</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Genre:</strong> Military Fantasy / Coming of Age
        <br />
        <strong>Pages:</strong> 591
        <br />
        <strong>Deal:</strong> Regularly discounted or free on Kindle
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Blood Song</em> follows Vaelin Al Sorna, a young warrior raised in
        a militant religious order, through a coming-of-age story that doubles
        as a military fantasy epic. The training sequences are addictive, the
        brotherhood dynamics are compelling, and the slow-burn political
        intrigue builds to an explosive second half. Originally self-published
        and still one of the highest-rated indie fantasy novels on Goodreads,{" "}
        <em>Blood Song</em> is frequently offered free as the first book in the{" "}
        <em>Raven&apos;s Shadow</em> series. It works beautifully as a
        standalone if you just want one satisfying read.
