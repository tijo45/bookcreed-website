        Let&apos;s be honest: if you finished <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em>{" "}
        (or binged the show) and immediately Googled &ldquo;books like Game of
        Thrones,&rdquo; you&apos;re not alone. George R.R. Martin cracked
        something open in the fantasy genre — a hunger for political intrigue,
        morally grey characters, and worlds where nobody is safe. The good news?
        Dozens of authors have answered the call, and some of them arguably do
        it better.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are ten fantasy books and series that scratch the same itch as
        Game of Thrones — with their own twists, their own worlds, and their
        own reasons to keep you up past midnight.

      <h2>1. The First Law Trilogy by Joe Abercrombie</h2>
      <p>
        If Martin cracked the door on grimdark fantasy, Abercrombie kicked it
        off its hinges. <em>The Blade Itself</em> introduces a cast of
        deeply flawed characters — a torturer, a barbarian, a vain nobleman —
        and puts them through a meat grinder of war, politics, and betrayal.
        The dialogue is razor-sharp, the action sequences are visceral, and
        Abercrombie has a gift for making you love characters you should
        probably despise. The follow-up <em>Age of Madness</em> trilogy adds
        industrial revolution politics to the mix, making it feel eerily
        relevant.
      </p>

      <h2>2. The Poppy War by R.F. Kuang</h2>
      <p>
        Drawing on Chinese history — particularly the Second Sino-Japanese War
        — Kuang&apos;s trilogy starts as a military academy story and evolves
        into one of the most devastating explorations of power and genocide in
        modern fantasy. Rin is a protagonist who makes choices that will haunt
        you long after the final page. Where Martin shows you the cost of war
        through shifting perspectives, Kuang shows it through one woman&apos;s
        descent from idealism to something far darker. Essential reading for
        anyone who thinks fantasy should challenge as well as entertain.
      </p>

      <h2>3. The Greenbone Saga by Fonda Lee</h2>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The Godfather meets kung fu fantasy&rdquo; is the elevator
        pitch, and it&apos;s accurate. <em>Jade City</em> follows two rival
        clans on the island of Kekon as they fight for control of jade — a
        magical resource that grants superhuman abilities. The political
        maneuvering is every bit as intricate as Westeros, but the setting
        draws on East Asian culture rather than medieval Europe, giving the
        whole series a freshness that the genre desperately needed. The family
        dynamics alone are worth the price of admission. All three books are
        out, so you can binge without waiting.
      </p>

      <h2>4. The Kingdom of Valdrath by Eva Noir</h2>
      <p>
        This indie series flew under the radar for a while, but readers who
        love Thrones-style succession drama are discovering it fast.{" "}
        <em>The Exile&apos;s Return</em>, the first of eight books, follows
        an exiled prince dragged back to a crumbling kingdom where three
        brothers are tearing each other apart over the throne. What sets
        Valdrath apart is the depth of its political systems — the author built
        an entire cultural database covering economics, religion, and social
        hierarchy before writing a single chapter. The result feels lived-in
        and authentic in a way that rewards attentive readers. If you want
        political fantasy where alliances shift every chapter and nobody is
        purely good or evil, this is your next series.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Tigana by Guy Gavriel Kay</h2>
      <p>
        Kay is the master of literary fantasy, and <em>Tigana</em> might be
        his finest work. Set in a Renaissance Italian-inspired peninsula, it
        follows a group of rebels trying to restore their homeland — a country
        so thoroughly conquered that even its name has been magically erased
        from memory. The prose is gorgeous, the moral questions are genuinely
        difficult, and the villain is one of the most sympathetic antagonists
        in all of fantasy. It&apos;s a standalone, which means you get a
        complete, devastating story in a single volume.
      </p>

      <h2>6. The Traitor Baru Cormorant by Seth Dickinson</h2>
      <p>
        If Littlefinger were the protagonist and you had to watch him
        sacrifice everything he loved for political power, you&apos;d get
        something like this book. Baru is a young accountant from a colonized
        nation who infiltrates the empire that destroyed her culture, planning
        to tear it down from within. The political scheming is next-level,
        the economics are surprisingly engaging, and the ending hits like a
        freight train. Dickinson doesn&apos;t flinch from showing the cost
        of revolution, and neither does Baru.
      </p>

      <h2>7. The Broken Empire by Mark Lawrence</h2>
      <p>
        Jorg Ancrath might be the most morally reprehensible protagonist in
        fantasy — and somehow you can&apos;t stop reading about him.{" "}
        <em>Prince of Thorns</em> drops you into the mind of a teenage
        warlord cutting a bloody path toward an empire, and Lawrence&apos;s
        terse, propulsive prose makes every page fly. The world has secrets
        that fundamentally change your understanding of the story, and the
        trilogy wraps in a way that&apos;s both satisfying and haunting. Not
        for the faint of heart, but neither was the Red Wedding.
      </p>

      <h2>8. The Goblin Emperor by Katherine Addison</h2>
      <p>
        Here&apos;s the curveball. <em>The Goblin Emperor</em> has all the
        political intrigue of Game of Thrones — court factions, assassination
        plots, the machinery of governance — but it&apos;s told through the
        eyes of a genuinely kind protagonist thrust onto a throne he never
        wanted. Maia, the half-goblin emperor, navigates a hostile court not
        with swords but with empathy and stubborn decency. It&apos;s proof
        that political fantasy doesn&apos;t have to be grimdark to be
        compelling. Sometimes the bravest thing a ruler can do is simply be
        good.
      </p>

      <h2>9. The Lies of Locke Lamora by Scott Lynch</h2>
      <p>
        Fantasy heist meets political thriller. Locke and his crew of
        gentleman thieves operate in a Venice-inspired city, running elaborate
        cons on the nobility — until a mysterious figure starts killing off
        the criminal underground and Locke gets caught between rival powers.
        Lynch&apos;s dialogue crackles, the plotting is intricate without
        being convoluted, and the found-family dynamics give the story
        emotional weight. Think Ocean&apos;s Eleven set in a world where the
        Lannisters run the casino.
      </p>

      <h2>10. The Winnowing Flame by Jen Williams</h2>
      <p>
        Williams blends epic fantasy with cosmic horror in a trilogy that
        moves between political scheming, apocalyptic warfare, and genuinely
        alien threats. The ensemble cast is diverse and compelling, the
        world-building is creative (a parasitic alien queen, war-beasts grown
        from a mystical tree), and Williams isn&apos;t afraid to get dark when
        the story demands it. It&apos;s an underrated gem that deserves a
        much bigger audience.

      <h2>What Makes Political Fantasy Work?</h2>
      <p>
        The best political fantasy shares a few qualities: consequences that
        stick, characters with competing moral frameworks (not just &ldquo;good
        vs. evil&rdquo;), and a world that feels like it would keep turning
        even if you closed the book. Martin set the standard, but the authors
        on this list have expanded the genre in directions he never went — from
        Kuang&apos;s unflinching look at colonialism to Lee&apos;s crime-family
        dynamics to the intricate power structures of Valdrath.
      </p>
      <p>
        The common thread? Every one of these books trusts you to handle
        complexity. There are no easy answers, no purely noble heroes, and no
        villains who are evil just because. If that&apos;s what you loved
        about Game of Thrones, you&apos;re going to love what comes next.
